The South African Police Service and Johannesburg Metro Police Department clashed with protesters in the central Johannesburg. Offices arrived in their numbers to seize counterfeit goods but were met with a hostile response. Vendors were seen throwing stones at the police who retaliated by firing rubber bullets. One street vendor claimed live ammunition was used but there was no independent confirmation of this. “Immediately when they arrived, [they] started throwing grenades and used live ammunition. That’s when the commotion happened.” A man was injured in the stomach. The police did not respond by the time of publication. ⚠️ALERT⚠️Riots in the Joburg CBD.

The police’s Xoli Mbele said they were just doing their jobs. “The police were doing their random crime-preventing duties… So they went there in conjunction with the JMPD and while they were trying to perform their duties there, some of the shop owners and their friends started stoning the police vehicles.” Mbele denied allegations that they used live ammunition. Mbele could not confirm if people were injured but Eyewitness News has independently verified that several people were hurt during the clashes.
