CAPE TOWN - Police in the Western Cape have assembled a team of organised crime detectives to investigate three incidents where seven people were shot and killed in Cape Town on Tuesday. In Siqalo informal settlement in Philippi, three people were found lying in the street with bullet wounds to their heads. In Samora Machel while people on their way to work at around 5 am, two bodies of women were found lying next to the road. They had been shot in the upper parts of their bodies. And in Delft, a 60-year-old woman and her son were killed and another wounded. The police's Frederick van Wyk said: “Police in Delft responded to a complaint of a shooting where they found the bodies of a 60-year-old female and a 27-year-old male who were both fatally wounded. Another 33-year-old male also sustained gunshot wounds to his legs and stomach, he was taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.” MORE ACTION Community policing forums have called for more action following the seven murders. Authorities have been implementing safety plans to combat gang violence and the army is finally involved, but many affected communities are not seeing enough positive results. In reaction to Tuesday's shootings, the Hanover Park CPF's Ebrahim Abrahams was calling for more action. “They’re working on plans and budgets but not into the killings that are still continuing.” The Delft CPF's Charles George believes the suburb needs surveillance. “We’re calling on the city and government to assist the community with their request to install CCTV cameras.” The Nyanga CPF has also put the responsibility on the community, calling on the public to come forward with information.
