Roth Watson was speaking at his father’s memorial service in Roodepoort west of Johannesburg on Friday morning. JOHANNESBURG - The son of former African Global Operations (formerly known as Bosasa) CEO Gavin Watson  has remembered him as “a man with unshakable faith and love so deep and pure for the Lord”. Roth Watson was speaking at his father’s memorial service in Roodepoort west of Johannesburg on Friday morning. "As you can imagine, dad always had the knack of calling you at the wrong time. Potentially at the gym on a treadmill, maybe while shopping at Pick n Pay for groceries. "But no matter what it was, we had to close with prayer with everything that we did. Sometimes it made some occasions a bit bizarre. Imagine praying out to God in the middle of a shopping mall or at the gym," he said.  Watson died in a car crash near OR Tambo International Airport  on Monday. He was accused by former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi at the state capture commission of bribing officials and benefitting illegally from tenders. It was alleged that he facilitated bribes to high ranking government officials in exchange for favours. Former Cabinet minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who is alleged to have benefitted from her association with Watson, was among those in attendance at his memorial. "Just to say to the Watson family: they never loved you because of your conviction, they still will not love you today. They will never forgive you for who you are. Just like Jesus Christ who was prosecuted yet, he was sent to Earth to become a symbol of faith and the symbol of pain," she said. Mokonyane was a close associate of the businessman who died this week in a car crash It was alleged at the state capture commission that she received money and gifts from him.
