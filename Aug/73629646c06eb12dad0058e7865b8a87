JOHANNESBURG - After four days of striking over pay disparities in the municipality, the City of Tshwane has reached an agreement with union Samwu. The strike started on Monday and saw the city thrown into chaos as workers blocked main roads with buses and trucks. In a tweet on Friday morning, the city said that the strike had now been terminated and it would work to restore services. Workers had demanded an 18% salary increase. Please note the Employer, IMATU and SAMWU have reached an agreement. The unprotected strike has been terminated. Details to follow. We'll work tirelessly to restore services.  Samwu said the City of Tshwane had committed to no longer paying its senior executives an 18% salary increase until it had gone through a benchmarking exercise. Workers were expected to return to work next week.
