Province scored seven tries to seal 45-14 victory over Pumas in a Currie Cup clash at Newlands Stadium on Friday. CAPE TOWN - Western Province coach John Dobson said they were expecting a tough battle against the Griquas in Kimberly this weekend. Province scored seven tries to seal 45-14 victory over Pumas in a Currie Cup clash at Newlands Stadium on Friday. The Cape-based side is back in semi-final contention and the clash against the Griquas will have a deep impact for the overall log. "It's going to be a great experience playing in Kimberly - tough one but great. At least there'll be interest in the game - which is great for rugby," Dobson said. Province captain Chris van Zyl added: "We’ve had some bad experiences in Kimberley and it’s hard to put a finger on why. Maybe it’s a combination of the conditions and their belief about home."
