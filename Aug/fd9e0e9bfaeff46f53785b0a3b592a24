A costs order was issued against former Land Reform Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane earlier this month. CAPE TOWN - Former Land Reform Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane has applied for leave to appeal an order by the Land Claims Court, relating to the District Six land saga. A costs order was issued against Nkoana-Mashabane earlier this month. The court found Nkoana-Mashabane, who's now a minister in the Presidency, failed to comply with a November court order to come up with a proper restitution plan for district six claimants. This order now falls on her successor Thoko Didiza. The court ordered Nkoana-Mashabane to personally pay the costs of the legal action. The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform was also instructed to pick up the bill for claimantsâ€™ legal fees in the contempt of court matter. In a statement released this week, Nkoana-Mashabane said while she noted the court order, she's put forward her reasons why the leave to appeal application should be considered.
