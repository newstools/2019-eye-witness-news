While there are arguments on Twitter over whether this constitutes harassment and an invasion of privacy, Cell C said it sees the incident in a very serious light and has contacted Felicity Chauke. JOHANNESBURG - South African mobile network Cell C has said it is dealing with a complaint from a female customer who went to one of its stores, was attended to by a male employee and then received unsolicited texts from him a few weeks later. Felicity Chauke tweeted Cell C on Thursday, relating how she and her mother had visited the Cell C Malelane store in Mpumalanga to update their contracts. She attached screenshots of texts from the employee who assisted them at the time. In the texts, the employee reveals that he took Chauke's number down as he was attending to them. The employee admitted that what he had done is not permitted, but said he'd gotten another job offer to work elsewhere.  While there are arguments on Twitter over whether this constitutes harassment and an invasion of privacy, Cell C said it sees the incident in a very serious light and has contacted Chauke. The network added that it is dealing with the matter through internal channels.  POPI ACT There are also concerns that this matter violates certain sections of the Protection of Personal Information (Popi) Act which make provisions for one's privacy and for subjects to be aware that their information is being accessed and used for other purposes than those they may have originally given consent to.
