Mlungisi Madonsela, aged 21, died in hospital in February after he was caught in the crossfire between authorities and protesting students at the Durban University of Technology. DURBAN - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has promised to review the decision to close the investigation into the death of Mlungisi Madonsela. Madonsela, aged 21, died in hospital in February after he was caught in the crossfire between authorities and protesting students at the Durban University of Technology. It was alleged a private security guard fired the shot that killed the third-year business administration student.  In June, the NPA said it wouldn’t prosecute in the 21-year-old’s case, citing a lack of evidence. But now, it said a senior prosecutor would relook the case. The NPA's decision to review Madonsela’s murder case came after a march by the Economic Freedom Fighters’ student command on the Durban City Hall earlier on Monday. Students handed over a memorandum to senior NPA officials, demanding they re-open the investigation into Madonsela’s death and ensure those responsible were put in jail. The NPA accepted the memorandum with a promise to respond to the matter soon. Meanwhile, Madonsela's sister Sibongile Mgenge has called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to prioritise the case in the same way he did with the murder of slain soccer star Senzo Meyiwa.
