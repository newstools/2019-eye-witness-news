The trio known as the Krugersdorp Killers have been sentenced to life in prison. JOHANNESBURG - The three murderers known as the Krugersdorp Killers have been handed a number of life sentences each. Cecilia Steyn, Zack Valentine and Marcel Steyn had been convicted on 32 counts, including murder, fraud and intimidation. The court found that the three and at least three others were behind the brutal murders of 11 people between 2012 and 2016. The trio were part of a group called Electus per Deus which means "chosen by god". Judge Ellem Francis did not hold back when handing down sentences on Cecilia Steyn, Zack Valentine and Marcel Steyn. He found that there were no compelling circumstances to move from the minimum prescribed sentences. Marcel Steyn, however, was sentenced differently for two of the murders. Instead of being sentenced to life for those killings, she was handed 15 years each, because she was 14 when she committed the crimes. She was still, however, given seven life sentences for the other murders she was party to, while Valentine and Cecilia Steyn were handed eight and 13 life sentences respectively. The sentences will run concurrently.
