DURBAN - eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will not be returning to her position as her leave of absence has been officially extended. The KwaZulu-Natal African National Congress (ANC)'s provincial executive council made the announcement on Tuesday. Gumede was placed on leave after she was charged with fraud, corruption and racketeering in May. Meanwhile, the ANC's Mdumiseni Ntuli said: “The PEC decided that the leave of absence for all affected comrades including the two mayors of New Castle and eThekwini [municipalities] respectively, as well as an [employee] of Eskom in eThekwini, should be further extended to allow more time for affected comrades of the organisation to finalise work on the matter.” Gumede is facing strong criticism from opposition parties in the eThekwini council.
