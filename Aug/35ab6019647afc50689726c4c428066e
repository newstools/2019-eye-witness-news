Speaking to Sowetan, Tunzi, who hails from the Eastern Cape, called the situation "sad". “People have been sending me screenshots of it [the poll] and it’s a bit sad. People have their opinion and it is what it is," she said. “Beauty is subjective. You look different to different people, which is why beauty is not even a thing for me. "I’d be more affected if someone said I wasn’t smart. Then I would have been hurt. But being pretty? I don’t really care and [I'm] not interested.”
