DURBAN - The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed that Zandile Gumede has been removed as eThekwini mayor and would be redeployed. The ANC's provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli confirmed Gumede’s axing during a briefing earlier on Tuesday. Gumede has been on extended special leave since her arrest in May on fraud and corruption charges related to a R208 million waste collection tender in 2016. The mayor’s bail conditions, which included her being barred from interacting with some municipal officials, were relaxed at her court appearance last week. Gumede’s case was postponed to January next year. The party said Gumede would be replaced within the next seven days. Ntuli also announced that the executives of both the eThekwini and Msunduzi municipalities would be redeployed. “All ANC members who are serving as exco members of eThekwini and Msunduzi local municipalities respectively should, with immediate effect, be redeployed. The PEC mandated the provincial working committee, working through the officials, to ensure that all working vacancies occasioned by this decision are filled.” CONFIRMED: #ZandileGumede and other senior Councillor’s deployed by the ANC at the eThekwini municipality have been removed and will be “redeployed”.
