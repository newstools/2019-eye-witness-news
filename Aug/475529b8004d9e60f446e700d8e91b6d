JOHANNESBURG - The Education Department in Limpopo has expressed shock after seeing a video of a teacher assaulting pupils in a class. The video, which has been widely shared on social media, shows a few pupils being slapped in the face by the male teacher. The school has been identified as Bopedi Bapedi Secondary in Sekhukhune South District. The department's Sam Makondo said: “It was brought to our attention this morning and we immediately dispatched a team of officials to the school to attend to this matter. It’s very serious given that corporal punishment has been outlawed- in this country and we expect teachers to understand that.”
