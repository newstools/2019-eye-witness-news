Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz was demanding answers. Here's his spokesperson Cayla Murray: "It should be noted that these relative successes are undermined by training and resource constraints within the SAPS." Police union Popcru has also voiced its concern. Spokesperson Richard Mamabolo: "If you look at the vehicles, if you look at the uniforms, if you look at the manpower, all those have had a negative impact on policing."
