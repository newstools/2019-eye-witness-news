JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters on Tuesday told the Equality Court a study on party leader Julius Malema’s speech in November last year showed he was clearly opposed to violence, despite being critical of journalists.

However, advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi insisted that the language used by the EFF leader was metaphorical. “The dominant impression is that there’s criticism for identifying journalists for behaving like propagandists. We also get the impression that Mr Malema is opposed to violence.” CIC @Julius_S_Malema arriving at the High Court where SANEF and various journalist have instituted legal action against the EFF in the equality court of Pretoria seeking relief by means of various interdicts. pic.twitter.com/NcTohMkyMe  Ngcukaitobi conceded that while Malema’s language may be crude or offensive, it did not amount to hate speech. The advocate also referred to the language used by Malema as hard-hitting. “Mr Malema said, ‘You’re sick. Go to hell.’ That was read out yesterday. That could be considered crude, insulting and even insulting, but it’s not hate speech. It’s not hate speech under section 10 of the Equality Act. It’s certainly not hate speech that the applicants are contending for, which is discrimination on the grounds of the profession.”
