DA provincial leader Patricia Kopane said that if the Speaker did not table the motion, the party would take legal action. JOHANNESBURG - Mangaung Mayor Olly Mlamleli will be hauled to court by the Democratic Alliance (DA) if the Speaker of the Free State's only metro doesn’t table a motion of no confidence filed by the party within seven days. The DA filed the motion after Moody’s downgraded the municipality to a B3 rating this week. DA provincial leader Patricia Kopane said if urgent steps were not taken, Mangaung would collapse. The Free State was one of three provinces that hasn’t had a single clean audit during the 2017/2018 financial year and Moody’s downgrading of its only metro, Mangaung, was no surprise to the DA. Kopane said that they wanted to see the back of Mlamleli. "We tabled a motion of no confidence on 28 May but the Speaker was ignoring the DA. We've given them seven working days [to respond]." Kopane said that if the Speaker did not table the motion, the party would take legal action. "One of the charges that we are going to lay against the mayor is that they're not making sure that the residents are living in a healthy environment. They're living in appalling conditions, where there's sewage everywhere in the townships." The DA said that Mangaung paid R61 million to a company contracted to collect revenue but it was still failing.
