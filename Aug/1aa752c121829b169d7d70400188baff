It later emerged that the person in the boot was a South African National Defence Force soldier. The police's Noloyiso Rwexana said there's been another breakthrough. “A 15-year-old boy was arrested this morning by a detective in connection to the murder, hijacking and kidnapping case that was reported when a body of a 43-year old man was found inside a boot.”
