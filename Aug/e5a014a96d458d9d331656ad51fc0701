The bank said that the link to them was purely coincidental. The Sunday Independent article also listed billionaire mining magnate Nicky Oppenheimer as having donated over R10 million, while former Absa CEO Maria Ramos reportedly gave over R1 million. Ramos was appointed last month to the Public Investment Corporation (PIC)’s interim board.

The president approached the Gauteng High Court in order to seal certain documents regarding his campaign’s funders, which he believed may have been obtained unlawfully.
