With many traditional agricultural sectors shedding jobs, she said the farming of cannabis would result in an unprecedented number of jobs. “If you look at how the sugar industry is shedding jobs and you look at the jobs that will be created by the cannabis industry, that will be five times more than the sugar industry.” Dube-Ncube said that in developing the cannabis economy, the province would ensure the regulation and licensing of cultivators and extractors.
