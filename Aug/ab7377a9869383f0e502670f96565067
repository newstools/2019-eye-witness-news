LONDON - England batsman Jason Roy has passed a concussion test after being hit in the nets ahead of the third Ashes Test against Australia at Headingley. The 29-year-old opener was struck by a throw-down from ex-England international Marcus Trescothick, working with the team in a temporary coaching capacity, during practice on Tuesday. World Cup winner Roy was assessed after taking the blow and was able to continue batting. But he also required a follow-up check on the eve of the match on Wednesday to determine any delayed symptoms. The Surrey right-hander will be assessed again before the third Test starts on Thursday. Australia's star batsman Steve Smith has already been ruled out of the match with a concussion suffered when he was hit by a Jofra Archer bouncer in the drawn second Test at Lord's. Ashes holders Australia lead the five-match series 1-0.
