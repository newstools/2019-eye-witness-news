The vehicles were either hijacked or stolen from various parts of the country, destined to be taken across the border. JOHANNESBURG - Police in Manguzi, KwaZulu-Natal seized 20 vehicles at the border between South Africa and Mozambique between the beginning of June to 4 August. The vehicles were either hijacked or stolen from various parts of the country, destined to be taken across the border. Eight suspects were arrested during these operations and have appeared in the Manguzi Magistrateâ€™s Court on charges of being in possession of suspected stolen vehicles. Among the seized vehicles are  trucks, bakkies and smaller cars. Some were found hidden in the dense vegetation, whilst others were intercepted just before they crossed the border. Police said the engine and chassis numbers on these vehicles had been altered, making it difficult to link the vehicles to vehicle-related crimes across the country.
