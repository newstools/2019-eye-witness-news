JOHANNESBURG - Retail trade sales have increased year-on-year by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and only 1.1% compared to last's quarter. Statistics South Africa released the report that reflects consumer purchase trends in the retail trade industry on Tuesday. In May, the Bureau of Economic Research found consumer confidence increased slightly after Eskom put load shedding on hold. The main contributors to the 2.4% increase were clothing, footwear, leather goods and general dealers. Sectors that recorded the largest annual growth sales include household furniture and appliances which grew by 5.2% and clothing which showed growth of almost 5% year on year. According to the Stats SA report, South Africans were buying less food, beverages and tobacco - recording negative growth of -0.1%. This figure may drop further after the Reserve Bank in July said food price inflation was expected to start rising from the end of the year to peak at 5.6% in the second and third quarters of 2020.
