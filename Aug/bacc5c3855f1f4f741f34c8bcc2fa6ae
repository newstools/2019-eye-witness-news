Last year, Catzavelos sparked outraged when he posted a video of himself on a Greek island remarking how happy he was about the absence of black people and using the K-word in the recording. JOHANNESBURG - Adam Catzavelos has reached a settlement with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) over his racist comments made while holidaying in Greece. The businessman appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Thursday where details of the R150,000 fine were disclosed. Last year, Catzavelos sparked outraged when he posted a video of himself on a Greek island remarking how happy he was about the absence of black people and using the K-word in the recording. SETTLEMENT CONDITIONS As part of the settlement reached with the SAHRC, Catzavelos must pay the Seth Mazibuko Legacy Foundation R150,000. He would pay this in installments over two years. The Seth Mazibuko Legacy Foundation is a charity organisation in Soweto, which promotes social cohesion, non-racialism, social justice, and reconciliations. Catzavelos also must do community service under the support of the foundation. A public apology written by the businessman was read out in court in which he again expressed how disgusted, horrified, and ashamed he was of his behaviour. He also acknowledged the harm his video had caused to black people. Catzavelos closed off his letter by saying he hoped South Africans would be able to forgive him.
