The documents include bank statements and email correspondence she used in her findings. JOHANNESBURG - The Public Protector has now filed records of the evidence she relied on in her investigation into whether President Cyril Ramaphosa misled Parliament about donations for his presidential campaign. The documents include bank statements and email correspondence she used in her findings. While the president has asked the deputy judge president to seal those records, many of them were leaked to the media and revealed the identities of some of the donors and the large sums of money they pledged towards Ramaphosa’s campaign. Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa misled Parliament when he said that the R500,000 donation from Bosasa was facilitated through his son's company. Bosasa, now known as African Global, was at the centre of allegations of grand scale corruption in government institutions. The Public Protector’s Oupa Segalwe said Mkhwebane complied with the rules of the court and submitted the required records related to her Bosasa investigation. Segalwe said: "The record includes all sorts of evidence the Public Protector based her findings on, which includes things like bank statements for the different accounts that are cited in the investigation report, it would include correspondence, basically every little piece of evidence that the Public Protector relied upon."
