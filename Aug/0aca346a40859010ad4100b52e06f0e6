Stuart Baxter confirmed that ahead of the must-win qualifier against Libya in March, doctors feared he may have cancer. JOHANNESBURG - Stuart Baxter has for the first time revealed how he dealt with health concerns while coaching Bafana Bafana. The 65-year-old announced his resignation on Friday. Baxter confirmed that ahead of the must-win qualifier against Libya in March, doctors feared he may have cancer. “It was amazingly difficult for me to concentrate, knowing that when I got back, I was going to get results that were going to tell me I have cancer or not.” It was still unclear what the future held for Baxter post-Bafana, with the coach himself admitting he could return to his home country of England. Meanwhile, the South African Football Association said they would start the search for a new coach on Saturday.
