Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself, and his body was found Saturday morning, The New York Times and other media said. NEW YORK - US financier Jeffrey Epstein, indicted on charges he trafficked underage girls for sex, committed suicide in prison, US news media reported Saturday. He hanged himself, and his body was found Saturday morning, The New York Times and other media said. Epstein, 66, had already been found in a cell in late July with marks on his neck after an apparent suicide attempt. The department's Bureau of Prisons made the announcement as questions were raised as to how a high-profile inmate who had apparently attempted to kill himself last month could take his life in what is supposed to be a highly secure federal facility in downtown Manhattan. The bureau staff began life-saving measures and Epstein was eventually rushed to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. "The FBI is investigating the incident," said the bureau.
