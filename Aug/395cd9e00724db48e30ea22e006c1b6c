The ANC wanted Herman Mashaba to go, arguing financial troubles in the country's biggest metro as well as poor service delivery. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has withdrawn its motion of no confidence against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. The motion was set to be tabled on Thursday afternoon. The ANC wanted Mashaba to go, arguing financial troubles in the country's biggest metro as well as poor service delivery. This would have been the third motion Mashaba has faced since he assumed office three years ago. The ANC’s Jolidee Matongo said they would table the motion again: “That’s why we’re saying we’re not cancelling the motion, the motion is withdrawn for now and we will serve it at the September meeting.” Meanwhile, Mashaba said the withdrawal of the motion was a reflection of a weakening ANC.
