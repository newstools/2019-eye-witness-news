CAPE TOWN - Four people have been arrested following the murder of a child and attempted killing of a relative in Lavender Hill. The six-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet on Saturday. She died in hospital. Her uncle was wounded. The anti-gang unit swooped on a house shortly after the shooting, arresting a man and seizing an illegal gun. Their investigation then led them to another house where two more suspects were apprehended. In a separate raid, a woman was also taken into custody and a firearm magazine was found which could be linked to the shooting.
