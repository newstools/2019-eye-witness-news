Over 1,200 people were left homeless after Sunday's blaze gutted their shacks. CAPE TOWN - Masiphumelele residents who were displaced by a fire have quickly rebuilt the structures they lost. Over 1,200 people were left homeless after Sunday's blaze gutted their shacks. One person died and several others were injured. It was not the first time this area has been hit by a massive fire, there have been several over the last five years. When EWN visited Masiphumelele in the aftermath of the blaze, Eugenia Siwela - like hundreds of other affected residents - was still dazed and trying to figure out her next steps. On Thursday, the area was completely transformed, with most shacks - like Siwela's - already erected, although missing the bare necessities. "I don't have a bed, I don't have a cupboard, I don't have anything." Siwela, like community leader Maswazi Nkosi, was fearful of another fire wrecking their lives as they've experienced year in, year out. "You can imagine, a fire has affected me, twice, maybe next time you're going to be inside the shack, and maybe you're going to be burnt down."
