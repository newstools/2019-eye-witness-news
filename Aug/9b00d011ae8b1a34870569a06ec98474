CAPE TOWN - Cape Town law enforcement officials have arrested an 11-year-old boy after he was caught in possession of an unlicensed firearm. The boy was apprehended near a school in Cravenby on Tuesday. This after officials patrolling in the area received a tip-off from a concerned resident. The City of Cape Town’s JP Smith said: “They searched the area and found the boy next to the school with a firearm in his hand. There are allegations that the child was sent to attack another child at the school and threatened a teacher in the process. This is deeply concerning, and we hope the necessary social interventions will be put in place to put this young man on a different path.”
