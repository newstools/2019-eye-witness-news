A friend of hers reported the matter to police after realising that her friend had not been seen in two months. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said the man showed officers where he buried the woman after being questioned. “Upon questioning, he pointed the police to a shallow grave inside the shack. The police and a rescue team searched and a body of a woman was found,” he said. The man was expected to appear at the Protea Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
