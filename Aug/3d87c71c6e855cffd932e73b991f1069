The president accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining emails from his presidential campaign. JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency said it was only fair that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane held back on the publication of the evidence she relied on in her report against Cyril Ramaphosa unless the court decided on the appropriateness of her having the information. Ramaphosa asked the Gauteng High Court to seal certain documents contained in Mkhwebane’s report. The president accused Mkhwebane of unlawfully obtaining emails from his presidential campaign. Mkhwebane found that the president misled Parliament in his response to a question about a R500,000 donation from Bosasa for his presidential campaign. She also said that the huge amounts of money donated to Ramaphosa’s campaign raised questions of money laundering and state capture. Meanwhile, Public Protector spokesperson Oupa Segalwe dismissed Ramaphosa's accusation that Mkhwebane improperly broadened her Bosasa investigation into the private matters of the president. Segalwe said the Public Protector was simply following the money. “We followed the money trail, we followed whatever lead we came across. She spent time dealing with that matter with that report,” he added.

Segwale said normally when a report was being reviewed in court, the office had to file the record of the information it relied on. Segalwe said Mkhwebane was ready to release the evidence in court. He said no law forced the Public Protector to keep evidence confidential. “There’s no law that requires us to keep information confidential. She has that discretion to decide what to do with that information.”
