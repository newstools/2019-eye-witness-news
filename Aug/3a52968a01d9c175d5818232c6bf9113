According to the organisation's corporate plan for the past year, the state-owned entity last made a profit in 2006 and has recently been kept afloat by government subsidies. On Thursday, the company’s board announced that its group CEO Mark Barnes resigned after three and a half years at the helm of the institution. The board said Barnes cited differences on forward strategy in relation to the structure of the postal service as a reason to leave the institution. Post Office board spokesperson Charles Nwaila said: “What we have decided to do is try to merge those Post Offices so that we can maximise and also optimise the operations there.” Meanwhile, Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams  said Barnes played an integral role in strengthening the South African Post Office after the announcement of his resignation. Ndabeni-Abrahams wished Barnes well, saying she hoped their paths would cross again.
