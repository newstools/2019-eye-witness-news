Treasury released the document on Tuesday titled Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth, and Competitiveness. JOHANNESBURG - Former Statistician-General Dr Pali Lehohla criticised Treasury's documents to encourage growth, saying it failed to talk to the country's triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. Treasury released the document on Tuesday titled Economic Transformation, Inclusive Growth, and Competitiveness. It was released on the Treasury's website for the public to comment by 15 September. The paper looks at possible structural reforms to boost economic growth by up to three percentage points and to create a million jobs in 10 years. On Wednesday, Lehohla said the proposals contained in the document didn't address some key issues. “As far as the key issues we are challenged within South Africa in terms of unemployment, poverty and inequality, the document hasn’t talked to that. It talks about a million jobs," he said. 'IT'S NOTHING NEW' Lehohla described Treasury’s economic strategy document as a rehash of old proposals, saying the paper didn’t have fresh ideas on how to kickstart the economy and create jobs. With the country’s sluggish economy and high unemployment, there has been a general call for government to come up with a plan to kickstart the economy and create jobs. Lehohla said the paper was just a compilation of various proposals from previous policy documents. “It’s a rehash of everything we’ve published before. There is nothing new except that we have a crisis of Eskom. That’s why it's placed disproportionate attention on the crisis of Eskom.” Click here  to read the full paper.
