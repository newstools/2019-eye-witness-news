JOHANNESBURG - Swedish teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in New York after travelling for 15 days on a sailboat. On arrival on Thursday, she had a strong message for US President Donald Trump, asking him to listen to science. “It is insane that a 16-year-old had to cross the Atlantic Ocean to make a stand.” She will be attending the UN Climate Summit in September and the COP25 Climate Conference in December. The teen is well known for her "school strikes" which have inspired a worldwide #FridaysForFuture climate change protest movement.
