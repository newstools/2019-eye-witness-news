He said nine out of 11 municipalities in the province ran the risk of being dysfunctional. The MEC said the committee would investigate and act on corrupt activities. “The terms of reference of the committee will be to inquire, making findings, report to the MEC concerning the following, guided by the Constitution, relevant legislation, policies, and guidelines, whether and to what extent municipalities are fulfilling their constitutional mandate,” Maile said. The committee would start work immediately and was given three months to carry out its work.
