WATCH:  Corpse taken to Old Mutual office  The FSCA which regulates financial institutions in the country says it’s in touch with the deceased Sifiso Mtshali's family to verify more information. The authority’s Makgompi Ramphasha said, “Throughout this process that we are involved in, we would want to establish whether there is poor service to the family. If there is poor customer outcomes to the family, and they have been prejudiced in a particular way – those are some of the issues that FSCA will have to take into account.”
