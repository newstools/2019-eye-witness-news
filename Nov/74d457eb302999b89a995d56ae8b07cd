Last month, the Public Protector issued a subpoena in a bid to obtain the information. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma has now given the South African Revenue Service permission to hand over his tax information to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Zuma put out a tweet on Tuesday saying he respected the office of the Public Protector and did not object to his records being handed over to her.   The Public Protector argues that she has the power to subpoena Zuma’s tax records. But Sars believes her power does not extend to taxpayers information. Sars commissioner Edward Kieswetter explains why the organisation doesn’t want Mkhwebane to get her hands on the records. “Sars has turned to the courts to clarify an important legal principle that underscores the democratic principle founded between Sars and taxpayers.” Last month, the Public Protector issued a subpoena in a bid to obtain the information after former Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane laid a complaint following damning details from journalist Jacques Pauw’s book The President’s Keepers. The book claims the former president pocketed undeclared money from a security company during his Presidency. While Sars commissioner Edward Kieswetter approached the High Court in Pretoria in an attempt to stop the subpoena. Mkhwebane has confirmed she will oppose the application.
