The president told delegates at the conference that the investment commitments amounted to R371 billion if R8 billion rand which is subject to regulatory and board approval processes was added. A beaming Ramaphosa also had a word for naysayers. "And for those who doubted right at the onset, and many people were very critical, dismissing this whole effort you're all involved in and said this is just a talk show and I'd like to say to them: this is no talk show, this is serious business."
