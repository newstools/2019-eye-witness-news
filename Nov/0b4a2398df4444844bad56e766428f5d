Local focus is on S&P Global expected review of South Africa’s sovereign rating, which has been on non-investment grade since 2017. “The significant fiscal slippage evident in the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement delivered on 30 October, without a tangible plan to stabilise the deteriorating fiscal scenario, could trigger a change in the outlook of S&P’s ratings,” analysts at NKC African Economics said in a note. “We expect that S&P will likely change the outlook to South Africa’s ratings from “stable” to “negative” this evening, following similar movements by both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s.” The Treasury said in October that South Africa’s budget deficit was projected to rise to a nearly two-decade high and its gross debt was set to soar as a weak economy leads to revenue shortfalls while bailouts for state-owned companies strain public finances.
