CAPE TOWN - Ongoing attacks on Metrorail infrastructure threaten the jobs of thousands of commuters who rely on trains to get to work. Train services were thrown into disarray on Thursday after 18 train carriages were destroyed in a fire at Cape Town Station.

Her father then gave her a lift to Harfield station in the southern suburbs and from there, she walked to Claremont to catch a taxi. She was an hour and a half late for work.  When she finally arrived, she was told by her manager to go back home because she lost an entire day's wages. She fears her job is on the line: “I’m scared my job is on the line. If I lose my job, then I don’t know.” The woman is one of the thousands affected by fickle train services caused by criminals
