CAPE TOWN - Various Cape Town communities will now have access to free WiFi. Google has announced the launch of its Google Station, an initiative that will see residents in several areas including Elsies River, Delft and Khayelitsha get access to the internet. The service, in partnership with Think WiFi, will also be available in more than 100 other locations like shopping malls and universities. Google’s chief business officer David Shapiro said the project would empower communities. “Google Station will service people with free internet where it’s really needed.
