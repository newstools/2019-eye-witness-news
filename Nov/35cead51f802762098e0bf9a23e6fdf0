JOHANNESBURG - Radio colleagues, politicians and 702 listeners have all paid tribute to broadcaster Xolani Gwala at a memorial service in North Riding. He lost his battle against cancer last Friday. Thursday morning saw a number of speakers including Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, who said South Africa has lost one of its greatest sons. Ndabeni-Abrahams said Gwala was passionate yet respectful of his guests and his craft and that his death hit her hard. “This was not a man who wanted to destroy Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. This was a man who was interested in helping a person learn.” Colleague and close friend Robert Marawa said he was a man who loved his career but his family more. “He was a family man and son of proud parents. It’s a dream you encapsulated.” Primedia Group CEO Omar Essack said: “He looked to ask the tough questions. He demanded the answers with humility, dignity and respect.” #xolanigwalamemorial a dream fulfilled.
