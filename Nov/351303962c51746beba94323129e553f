JOHANNESBURG - Tshwane MMC for Roads and Transport Sheila Senkubuge has resigned from her position days after she was placed of special leave. Senkubuge is accused of having sexual relations with Tshwane mayor Steven Mokgalapa in the officer and sharing sensitive information about colleagues in the metro. In her resignation letters seen by EWN, Senkubuge thanks the DA for giving her the opportunity to serve as a black and youngest female MMC. Mokgalapa and Senkubuge have denied being in a romantic relationship. The mayor has described a leaked audio recording believed to be that of the pair discussing sensitive information about their colleagues and engaging in sexual intercourse as blackmail. The DA's John Moody said, “I also believe a private citizen has laid criminal charges regarding that she could be under voter’s roll… That’s for the IEC to deal with.”
