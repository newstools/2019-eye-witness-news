"We view with concern the dramatic development of events in Bolivia, where the wave of violence unleashed by the opposition did not allow Evo Morales to complete his presidential mandate," the foreign ministry said in a statement. Russia expressed "deep concern" over the events, which it said, "followed the scenario of a staged coup d'etat". It said that Morales' government had been ready to seek "constructive solutions on the basis of dialogue." "We call on all political forces in Bolivia to show common sense and responsibility," the statement said, pressing for a "constitutional way out of the situation."
