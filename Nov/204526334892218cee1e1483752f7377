CAPE TOWN - A 17-year-old boy is expected in court on Monday for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl. The alleged attack happened last Wednesday at a Grassy Park home. The local community policing forum's Philip Bam said the girl’s mother apparently found the youth assaulting her daughter. “The family is very upset. They tried to sort out this man, but they did not harm him too much. This is unfortunate and says a lot about the values we have left.”
