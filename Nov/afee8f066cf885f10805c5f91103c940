CAPE TOWN - SAA'S acting CFO Deon Fredricks said that management had bent over backwards to make a deal with striking unions but they won't budge. Unions including Numsa, the SA Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) and Satawu were angry over restructuring plans which could see more than 900 retrenchments. They'd also rejected the airline's 5.9% pay increase offer, demanding 8%. Fredricks said that all attempts to resolve the impasse had failed. "We'd given them a new offer that we will pay them six months back pay in April, the balance in October. We will then also increase their salaries by 5% in April. Yesterday, we improved that offer, that we will pay them in March and we will go and look for funding to go and pay for that."
