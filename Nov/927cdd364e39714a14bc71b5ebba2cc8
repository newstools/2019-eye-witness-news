Analysts attributed that to a constitution that gave too much power to the prime minister alone – and prime ministers used that power to call for elections whenever they lost votes of no confidence in Parliament – instead of stepping down. The other issue was who was the commander in chief of the army - between the king, who is head of state with no executive powers - and the prime minister. The reforms were expected to clarify, among others, who between the king, the prime minister and Parliament should have the power to appoint and fire commanders. Ramaphosa said with the conclusion of the multi-stakeholder dialogue and the establishment of a national reforms authority, Lesotho was now closer to coming off the Southern African Development Community agenda as a problem.
