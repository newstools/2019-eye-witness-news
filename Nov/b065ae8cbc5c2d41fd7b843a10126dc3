Last week, a court ruled that statements made by EFF leader Julius Malema about certain reporters and editors could not be classified as hate speech under the Equality Act. JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) will now look for other recourse to tackle the harassment of journalists after losing to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in a recent court case. Last week, a court ruled that statements made by EFF leader Julius Malema about certain reporters and editors could not be classified as hate speech under the Equality Act. Sanef has decided not to appeal the ruling. The forum’s general secretary Adriaan Basson said: “I think the Equality Act is definitely due for the Constitutional Court and the definition of hate speech is very narrow. One can understand that in a country and Constitution that champions free speech, journalists or anyone who feels intimidated and harassed should find some other recourse in law.”
