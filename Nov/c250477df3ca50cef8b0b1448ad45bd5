KEMPTON PARK - The first group of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters has now joined the South African Airways (SAA) s trike in Kempton Park in solidarity with disgruntled cabin crew and technical employees. Workers are demanding an 8% salary hike, insourcing and an end to retrenchment plans. SAA is offering 5.9% and has offered to set up a task team to look into the demands. A group of people waving the EFF flag were welcomed by striking staff with jubilation and loud cheering. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) workers were dancing and singing at the SAA parking lot and earlier they tried to demonstrate on the street but were prevented by police. Meanwhile, Sacca and Numsa have agreed to meet with SAA management at the  Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration on Saturday for mediation.
