They restored the potential inspiration, that potential that we are one nation and we are united.” At the same time, Ethekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said the victory has inspired government to make South Africans proud. “The manner in which you have tackled the challenge, moving forward, up until you became the champions is a clear indication that we are still able to face challenges head-on. Challenges relating to unemployment, poverty and inequality.’ The Boks’ tour brought the entire city to a standstill. People came out in their numbers wearing their Springbok jerseys. They danced and sang Shosholoza andNkosi Sikelela i-Afrika as they celebrated. For a moment, the focus was not on the political tensions that have engulfed the city in recent months.
