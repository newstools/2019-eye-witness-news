JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma will return to the state capture commission next week after his last appearance saw his legal team butt heads with the commission's evidence leaders. Zuma was meant to appear last week but had asked for a postponement to deal with his corruption case. Media Statement.#StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/s9J2JuhRnc  Last month, chairperson of the state capture commission Raymond Zondo slammed dishonest reports in the media about the work of the inquiry. The deputy Chief Justice rubbished a Business Day report claiming that former President Jacob Zuma had been furnished with 80 questions contained in an 11-page document prior to his next appearance at the commission. But Zondo said this was not true as the commission’s evidence leader Paul Pretorius had, in agreement with Zuma’s lawyers, sent them areas of interest which his questions would be based on. As a result of the incorrect report, Zondo said he would release the document sent to Zuma to the public. "Subsequent to me being aware of the article in Business Day, I asked Mr Pretorius to give me the document that he had sent to counsel for Mr Zuma. Before that, he told me there were no questions that he had sent." Additional reporting by Theto Mahlakoana.
