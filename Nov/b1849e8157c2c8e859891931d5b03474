Mthetwa spoke at a briefing last night alongside Kolisi and Erasmus who, along with the coveted Web Ellis trophy, were the last group to arrive from Japan to a rousing reception at OR Tambo International Airport. Mthethwa said that there were lessons to be learnt from their historic win. "They affected people outside the field [of play] which is 57 million people in South Africa. Their win covered our country with glory and as they did that they made us come closer to each other as South Africans." GALLERY: A rapturous welcome for the Springboks
