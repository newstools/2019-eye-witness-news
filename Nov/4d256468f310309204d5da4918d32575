Thabani Mzolo stands accused of the 2018 shooting of Zolile Khumalo in front of another student at a university residence. DURBAN - The trial against a Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student accused of killing his ex-girlfriend is set to continue in the Durban High Court on Tuesday morning. Thabani Mzolo stands accused of the 2018 shooting of Zolile Khumalo in front of another student at a university residence. The court heard on Monday, through a key witness, that Mzolo had previously threatened to kill Khumalo if she left him. The roommate of slain MUT student Khumalo testified that her murder was preceded by a series of abusive incidents. Nosipho Bhengu recounted that Khumalo had told her that Mzolo was violent and overly-possessive. Bhengu informed the court that she was in the room when Khumalo was shot. Bhengu relayed that Khumalo had sent her a message two days before she was murdered, saying that she had broken up with Mzolo. Mzolo faces charges of murder as well as the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Bhengu is set to continue her testimony on Tuesday.
