Maimane resigned from the party, saying that the organisation was not the vehicle best suited to take forward the vision of building one South Africa for all. The DA’s presiding officer Desiree van der Walt. "I had a letter in which he informed me that he no longer wished to contest and therefore withdraw his nomination for interim leader."
