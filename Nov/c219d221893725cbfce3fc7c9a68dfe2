Eskom is tied into a number of coal contracts that sees it paying inflated prices. Mabuza said government met with suppliers to try and get them to drop their prices. “The negotiations are still under way and there are positive signs that they’re going to be lowered.” However, he said government was not prepared to have workers laid off if coal prices come down. “Companies are prepared to lower down the cost of coal but obviously, they’re raising a lot of issues that involve labour to say if they reduce the costs, they’ll have to lay off workers, which as government we say no.”
