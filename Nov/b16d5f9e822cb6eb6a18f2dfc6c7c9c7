JOHANNESBURG - Kingswood College in Makhanda, in the Eastern Cape, has described a racial incident at the school as completely unacceptable and insists the school is committed to transformation. Tensions have been running high on Wednesday after black pupils took to social media, alleging that their white classmates mates were referring to them as “snoobab”. The term is the word “baboons” spelt backwards. The pupils have accused the school of ignoring their grievances.
