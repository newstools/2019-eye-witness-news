It's been revealed that 42-year-old Luyanda Botha entered into a plea and sentencing agreement. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court has thrown the book at a former Post Office teller who raped and murdered Uyinene Mrwetyana. Luyanda Botha (42) has been handed three life sentences and five years with no prospect of parole. He entered into a plea and sentencing agreement on Friday. As Luyanda Botha entered the dock, members of the public gallery shouted at him and called him “Satan”.  Several members of the Mrwetyana family, including the deceased’s brother and parents, were present. The court heard the confession Botha submitted to police and the gruesome account of what occurred on 24 August, the day Uyinene Mrwetyana was raped and murdered. Family members wept as they heard the details of how the Post Office teller lured her to the Clareinch branch, raped her and bludgeoned her. His plea also described how he hid her body in a safe and tried to dispose of it the next day. Botha received three life terms for raping and murdering the 19-year-old student, as well as five years for defeating the ends of justice.
