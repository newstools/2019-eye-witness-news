LENASIA - Community members in Lenasia are in shock on Monday after a fire claimed the life of a five-year-old girl. Aafreen Soosiwala died from smoke inhalation when the blaze broke out at her home on Monday morning. It’s understood the blaze broke out at around 8 am on the second floor of a double story building; the cause of the fire was not yet known. The girl is being laid to rest this afternoon. While a portion of Albatross Street remains busy with residents wanting to see the damaged building, another portion of the area is silent. This is because funeral proceedings for Soosiwala are being held at a relative's house just down the road. Men and women have been walking in and out of the house to offer their condolences to the family. All have declined to talk to the media, saying they do not know what happened and would like to respect the family's privacy. While Soosiwala's mother has come home for the funeral, the victim’s 13-year-old sister is in a critical condition in hospital. Earlier, Motorists and neighbours were slowing down on Albatross Street to look at the apartment ravaged by the deadly fire.
