Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke has released the inequality trends in South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - Statistics South Africa confirmed the country is one of the most unequal countries in the world with black people having the highest unemployment rates. It said the figure was about four times higher compared to white people. Statistician general Risenga Maluleke released The Inequality Trends in South Africa Report on Thursday. The inequality trends report has found that the white population in South Africa has the highest real annual median expenditure compared to other population groups. “As we can see from 2015, the white population group was sitting slightly above 100,000 compared to Indian and Asian population at 37,000,” said Maluleke. He said black people were also amongst the most vulnerable and have the lowest access to medical aid coverage. According to the report, black and coloured-headed households are the only groups classified as chronically poor. INEQUALITY DECREASE FOR SOME Statistics South Africa said there was a decrease in inequality for white, Indian and Asian people in South Africa but an increase for black people between 2006 and 2015. “We should be able to unpack further and say the household expenditure share for black South Africans grew from 41.8% to 49.3% between 2006 and 2015,” Maluleke explained. He said research showed that labour market income was the main driver of income inequality in the country. Maluleke added while economic income increased for black South Africans, it remained constant for coloured people, while it decreased for Indian, Asian and white people.
