Van Loggerenberg has dismissed the report as a concoction of lies, misinformation and a cover up of evidence and facts implicating people associated with the state security agency. The report is based on information from agency operatives implicated in discrediting Sars officials. The former Sars executive says the report relies on hearsay and fails to reflect evidence he gave to the inspector general in 2014. He says he’s seeking a court to review the reports and set it aside.
