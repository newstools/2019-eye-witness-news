The two nations will be meeting for the fourth time this year, with South Africa having had won one during the Quad Series and England winning twice during the 2019 Netball World Cup. Coach Dorette Badenhorst used the Africa Netball Cup last month as a trial to assess players and help them choose a team that will face the Roses. "We will select the final 12 players to play against England after a few days of training and camp. We are looking forward to an interesting Test series with a lot of new players in the England team as well as experienced players, like Stacey Francis, who will be back on court for England," said Badenhorst. "After the completion of the series will select the 12 players who will participate in the Vitality Nation Cup in January 2020." The final 12 players will be announced on the 28 of November 2019.
