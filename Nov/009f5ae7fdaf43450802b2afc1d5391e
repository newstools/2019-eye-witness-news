NEW YORK â€“ Wall Street stocks were flat early Friday as a top White House advisor said the United States could postpone new tariffs on China but would not roll back existing levies.

The comments raised doubts about Chinese statements Thursday that the two sides had agreed to remove tariffs as part of a preliminary "phase one" trade agreement that was agreed last month but has yet to be finalized.
