However, Gift of the Givers director Badr Kazi said refugees told them to leave because they were angered by his view that their demand to be relocated en masse was unrealistic. “I said their demands are unrealistic and I stand by that because if you look at the Refugee Act, you can’t ask a country to send you to another country.” Refugee leader Papy Sukumi explained why they were angered by the comments. “They said it was unrealistic.
