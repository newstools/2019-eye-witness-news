De Klerk, 28, initiated the #FafChallenge online on Wednesday, posting a picture of himself flaunting his now famous South African flag-themed underpants. He instantly became an internet hit after he was photographed greeting Prince Harry in the pants just moments after their World Cup victory against England in Japan. "Be ballsy enough to check your balls!" he told his more than 36,500 followers on Twitter. "Challenging Siya, Jesse, and all of you to get into your speedo & post a pic to help spread the word on this important cause!" The disease is one of the most common cancers in men aged between 15 and 39 years. De Klerk told a local rugby magazine that he was surprised by the public reaction to his underpants. "There is no massive back story. I just always play in a South African speedo when I play for the Springboks. I’ve probably played the last two years with it," he was quoted as saying by SARugbyMag. The Springboks beat England 32-12 victory against England in Japan on 2 November, earning their third world crown in rugby's paramount tournament.
