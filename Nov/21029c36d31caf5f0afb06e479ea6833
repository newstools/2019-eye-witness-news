JOHANNESBURG â€“ The 2019 South African Literary Awards (Sala) honoured some impeccable work in the literary and writing space on Thursday.

Several newcomers, as well as established artists, came together to share accolades at the ceremonyâ€™s 14th installment. The main aim of the awards is to pay tribute to South African writers who have distinguished themselves as groundbreaking producers and creators of literature, while it celebrates literary excellence in the depiction and sharing of South Africaâ€™s histories, value systems and philosophies and art as inscribed and preserved in all the languages of South Africa --particularly the official languages. Some of the winners included PhD student Lebohang Masango in the Childrenâ€™s Literature category for the book title Mpumiâ€™s Magic Beads. Shout out to my small magic. We made sure to publish it in all 11 South African languages so that every one of your babies can read, dream and enjoy. ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ðŸ“š pic.twitter.com/OYeN7rCh9A  The Youth Literature Category went to novelist and short story writer Sally Partridge for the book entitled Mine.
