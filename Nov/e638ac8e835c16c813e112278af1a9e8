DA candidates appear to be the front-runners in all of today's by-elections to be held in the City of Cape Town and the Matzikama Municipality. CAPE TOWN - Political parties square off in several by-elections in the Western Cape on Wednesday. For the Democratic Alliance (DA), any victories will provide some reprieve following a tumultuous few weeks. The party is in a state of flux with new leadership figures coming in and outgoing leaders criticising its commitment to transformation. DA candidates appear to be the front-runners in all of today's by-elections to be held in the City of Cape Town and the Matzikama Municipality. In Cape Town, parties will be contesting two wards - one in Wesbank near Blue Downs and another in Mitchells Plain. DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said the party was doing everything for a win. "If we retain the three wards it will send a strong message that the party is turning the corner because there's no denying that the party has faced a very difficult time and challenges over the last month." The Good Party is fielding candidates in the two Cape Town by-elections. The African National Congress (ANC) looks set to win the Matzikama by-election given its strong presence in the region.
