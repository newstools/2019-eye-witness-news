Du Plessis has also applauded the Springboks on their Rugby World Cup win - saying it means a lot for the country. "I've broken my heart many times with goosebumps, 80 minutes of play... when I look at Siya [Kolisi] and other players on TV I was like... goosebumps everywhere. I'm so proud of the way they represented South Africa."
