There are still celebrations on the ground with cars hooting and people waving. Every few streets the team find themselves needing to duck down because of the low-lying electrical lines. The Eastern Cape is the home province of many players including captain Siya Kolisi and Lukhanyo Am. As the cheers and whistles continue, the convoy will stay on the road until early afternoon.
