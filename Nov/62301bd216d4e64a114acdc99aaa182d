Officials from the Cooperative Governance Department held a briefing in Dubran on Thursday after several parts of the province were ravaged by severe storms over the past four days. JOHANNESBURG - Sixteen people have been killed since 25 October 2019 in KwaZulu-Natal due to inclement weather conditions in the province. This was according to Lennox Mabaso, spokesperson for the Cooperative Governance Department in the province. Five people were killed this week alone. Officials from the Cooperative Governance Department held a briefing in Durban on Thursday after several parts of the province were ravaged by severe storms over the past four days. The officials said that disaster management teams would be dispatched to all 11 disaster management centres in the province to assist in relief efforts in the wake of the devastating downpours. MEC Sipho Hlomuka said that the centres would provide immediate assistance to affected municipalities. "All our municipalities have been instructed to join the district operations centre which will co-ordinate the response to crises as and when they happen." He's urged residents across the province to brace for what's being described as a "mega-storm" for the rest of the week following another warning of gale-force winds and hail from the SA Weather Service "We requested that schools be closed today and tomorrow. We've also asked various leaders to release workers early and allow people to work from home rather than report to the workplace in terms of public safety because the safety of the people is very important." Houses have been flattened, roads flooded and trees uprooted in the latest spell of bad weather. Some warnings predicted rain in the coming hours could be worse than the storms in April where scores of people were killed.
