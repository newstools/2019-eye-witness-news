A ‘City Press’ report at the weekend said the foundation intended to meet with Mandela after her tweets last Friday, in which she talked about 'land thieves' and apartheid apologists'. JOHANNESBURG - The Nelson Mandela Foundation  on Tuesday denied reports that it requested a meeting with South Africa’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela, over her Twitter remarks on land expropriation without compensation. This after City Press reported at the weekend that the foundation intended to meet with Mandela following her tweets last Friday on the social media platform, in which she tweeted and retweeted comments about “land thieves” and “apartheid apologists”. Her comments, which divided many Twitter users, prompted AfriForum to call to for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation to fire Mandela as the country’s ambassador to Denmark. The foundation issued a statement on Tuesday, correcting the City Press report. “The Nelson Mandela Foundation has noted, with concern, the article by Jacob Rooi, whose headline suggests that the foundation intends summoning Ms Zindzi Mandela to a meeting regarding her alleged tweets on Friday, 15 June,” the foundation said in a statement. The foundation further said it declined to comment on Mandela’s posts to the publication on Monday because it had no insight into the story or what motivated her tweets, as well as whether the tweets were from her. “The foundation wishes to stress that it has no intention of requesting a meeting with Ms Mandela regarding the tweets.”
