CAPE TOWN - City of Cape Town officials were on high alert after the weather office predicted localised flooding in some parts of the city. Heavy rains were battering Cape Town on Tuesday afternoon. Adverse weather conditions were expected to last until Wednesday. Forecaster Lauren Smith said: “Heavy rain is expected over the mountainous areas of the Overberg and the Southern Cape Winelands and over the Cape metropole for today, the remainder of the evening and into tomorrow morning. From tomorrow onwards, we have the localised urban flooding which is expected.” Smith added gale force winds of 50-65 kilometres per hour were expected over the Central Karoo and Breede Valley in the Western Cape on Wednesday.   Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town said plans were in place to assist residents affected by flooding as heavy rains continued. The City's Charlotte Powell said staff would be activated when incidents occur. “We remain in contact with the weather services and should anything happen, we’ll activate other roleplayers.” Powell said they had identified halls for emergency shelter. She added that standby crews from the transport and sport and recreation departments would also deal with fallen power lines and trees. “Other stakeholders include Sassa, the police services, the defence force but this is only should anything major happen.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
