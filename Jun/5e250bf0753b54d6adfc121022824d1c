CAPE TOWN - The African Diaspora Forum says a victim of Sunday’s clashes between police and traders in the Johannesburg CBD remains critical in hospital with eight bullet wounds from live ammunition. Forum chairperson Vusumuzi Sibanda said members - who often face intimidation and extortion from corrupt officials - wanted police to show that they were conducting legal searches. “You have a situation where people are going there to instigate violence, ill-treating them so that they respond and they have an excuse for shooting them. Yesterday was such a case, people were shot and live ammunition was used,” Sibanda said.
