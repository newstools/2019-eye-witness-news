JF pic.twitter.com/Xh2qKKD3Vk  Mazzone told Eyewitness News what she was hoping for from Ramaphosa‚Äôs speech. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping that the president announces that there is going to be real reform at Eskom. We were told in the last Sona that Eskom would be changes and we haven‚Äôt seen these changes yet. Eskom still remains one of the biggest threats to our economy,‚Äù she said. ‚Ä¢  Economy, jobs, SOEs to feature as key points in Sona EWN also questioned Mazzone on the DA‚Äôs stance in the alleged racial incident involving fellow member Phumzile Van Damme at the V&A Waterfront earlier this week.

And I have no doubt that she will inform the party as to what are the outcomes are," Mazzone said.

The three are guests of the DA and together form a musical act called Cathy and the Trolley Dollies. The three long-legged beauties clad in sparkly, skimpy black flight attendant outfits caused quite a stir on the red carpet in the Parliamentary precinct. They go by the names Cathy, Holly and Molly. Holly and Cathy said the DA invited them to highlight the importance of diversity in society. Other MPs and special guests have also arrived ahead of the speech.
