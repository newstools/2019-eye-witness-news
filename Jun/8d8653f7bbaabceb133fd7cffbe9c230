The party's secretary-general, Ace Magashule, briefed the media on Tuesday afternoon following the party's NEC lekgotla over the weekend. “The lekgotla agreed that unemployment is now going to be a national emergency, we’re declaring unemployment a national disaster," said Magashule.

The parastatals will soon be without CEOs after Vuyani Jarana resigned from the state airline citing lack of support to implement the company's turnaround strategy. Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe also stepped down in May citing ill health. Magashule has described what’s happening at Eskom and SAA as a crisis. “The lekgotla resolved that fixing Eskom, the SAA and many other parastatals should be an apex priority and noting the fiscal and economic threat that this poses.”
