Currently, anyone who applied for a post mustâ€™ve been a registered traffic officer. CAPE TOWN - The City of Cape Town says it will ease its metro police recruitment process, as anyone who applies for a post currently needs to be a registered traffic officer. That requirement, the municipality says, is slowing down efforts to bolster the metro police's ranks. The city petitioned the national police commissioner, who had apparently agreed to waive that requirement. But the Western Cape transport MEC would have to be consulted to take the matter forward.
