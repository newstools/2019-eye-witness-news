The chief justice was speaking during a Directors Event in Johannesburg on Friday. JOHANNESBURG - Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has called on South Africans to be brave and deal with issues of racism that still exist in society. Mogoeng was speaking during the fifth edition of the Directors Event in Johannesburg on Friday. The gathering brings together senior managers and executives to discussing youth unemployment, digital transformation and politics. “Let’s find solutions to these things that divide us like racism. Let us engage in very uncomfortable debates so that we can get there,” he said. The Chief Justice also called for a renewed focus on implementation in the country, saying South Africa was full of incredible dreams and plans but falls short when it comes to putting those plans into practice. ACCOUNTABILITY South Africans should insist that stringent mechanisms be put in place that would scrutinise those who want to occupy places of authority, Mogoeng said. He said the country was in trouble if what was coming out of the Zondo Commission, which is probing allegations of corruption and state capture, was true. Mogoeng said only those with the integrity to assume leadership responsibilities should be allowed to contest for those positions. “It matters who becomes a Cabinet minister, mayor, and a premier. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have a situation where all of the 257 municipalities only 18 have clean audits. Something is fundamentally wrong about the selection process,” he said.
