CAPE TOWN - No arrests have yet been made following an arson attack on a truck near Touws River. The driver had pulled over along the N1 on Sunday morning to rest when a petrol bomb was lobbed into the vehicle. He was seriously injured. During a separate incident last month, five people appeared in court after they allegedly looted a truck that had come under attack in the De Doorns area. The truck driver died when a rock was hurled at his vehicle from a footbridge over the N1 on Sunday, causing him to lose control. Meanwhile, an inter-ministerial committee was set up to investigate the torching of several freight trucks in KwaZulu-Natal on a section of the N3 over the weekend. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
