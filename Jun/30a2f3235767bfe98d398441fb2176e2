They are facing charges of housebreaking with the intent to rob, possession of a firearm and the pointing of a firearm. CAPE TOWN â€“ Amid calls for rural safety to be beefed up, four men are back in court later this month in connection with an armed robbery on a farm in Klapmuts. The men from Wellington allegedly held up a mother and her two children on the fourth of June. They are facing charges of housebreaking with the intent to rob, possession of a firearm and the pointing of a firearm. The four suspects are expected back in court on 19 June to consult with their lawyer. A bail application is expected to be heard on 26 June. The accused are believed to have broken into a house on Glen Gall Farm in Klapmuts and assaulted a woman in front of her two children. The woman sustained a head wound, but her children were unharmed. Meanwhile, police are yet to make an arrest in connection with the murder of Stefan Smit during a robbery on Louiesenhof Wine Estate in Stellenbosch. That same night an elderly couple's house on a farm nearby was also broken into. This happened two days before the Klapmuts incident. The provincial government is working on a plan to help ensure safety on farms, while there have been calls on the president to fast track a national rural safety plan.
