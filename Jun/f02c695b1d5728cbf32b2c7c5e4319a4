ANC spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen explained: "Today was a good day for the ANC. They took control of the Cederberg Municipality. We are getting ready for the next municipal elections." DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said DA councillor Bertie Sazz helped the ANC. He said the party would not allow rogue members to cause destruction. "The key thing is that the party must be able to act against those people. I find it disheartening that people subject themselves to the party's constitution and then go against it."
