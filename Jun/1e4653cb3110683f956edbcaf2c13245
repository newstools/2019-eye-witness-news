Several departments have been raiding preschools in Sophiatown, west of the city. JOHANNESBURG – The Johannesburg Department of Health and Social Development issued two notices of closure to two early childhood development centres on Tuesday. Several departments have been raiding preschools in Sophiatown, west of the city. The blitz comes on the back of the rat poisoning deaths of two children at an unregistered crèche in the area. MMC for Health and Social Development Mpho Phalatse and her entourage raided six preschools on Wednesday morning. Among the six facilities, two were ordered to close down immediately, as they didn’t comply with regulations. Phalatse said the aim of the operation was to ensure that the operators of early childhood development centres complied with regulations. She added more raids would follow in due course.
