In a separate incident, a woman died on the tracks near Elsies River on Thursday. Delays of up to 60 minutes were expected. Metrorail’s Riana Scott said: “A small group of employees elected to disregard Prasa procedures to share their concerns. Regional management immediately addressed the issue and employees resumed work shortly thereafter.
