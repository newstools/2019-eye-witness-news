The appointment, which was announced at a briefing on Friday, follows the resignation of Vuyani Jarana. JOHANNESBURG - South African Airways (SAA) has announced Zuks Ramasia will take over as interim CEO. Her appointment, which was announced at a briefing on Friday, follows the resignation of Vuyani Jarana last week. Jarana recently raised concerns that legislation was stifling the airline’s competitiveness, making it difficult to compete in the market. The board has announced Ramasia's appointment during a briefing at the airline's head offices in Johannesburg. “We just want you to stand up a bit so that people can see you. As the acting CEO of the SAA in the interim until the process that we’re starting to source permanent CEO has gone the full hog,” said SAA board member Thandeka Mgoduso during the briefing. She said the board had commenced a search, domestically and globally, for a permanent CEO. “So that we can get a good return in terms of the CVs that we shall be looking at.” Mgoduso said the board had accepted Jarana's request not to serve his full notice and that there was a mutual agreement for him to leave office sometime next week.
