Sizakele Mzimela resigned from her position as chief executive of the struggling airline in 2012 after clashes with then-Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba. JOHANNESBURG – Former South African Airways (SAA) CEO Sizakele Mzimela says during Malusi Gigaba's time as minister of public enterprises, communication between the department and the airline began to deteriorate. Mzimela resigned from SAA in 2012 after clashing with Gigaba. She said under Barbara Hogan, who was Gigaba's predecessor, not just anyone could walk into monthly meetings but when Gigaba took over, “things changed” and persons not known to SAA management would request information. She said this started causing problems. “Under Minister Gigaba, things were beginning to fall through the cracks in terms of the management of information and the management requests that were coming from members of the executive who in the past had no relationship with the organisation. For me, that was a breakdown in good governance.” Evidence leader Veruschka September said: “The evidence that this witness presents today augments evidence that’s already been placed before this commission. Alternatively, just corroborates versions that have been placed before this commission.” Mzimela is currently the acting CEO of SA Express.
