On Sunday, a young man was shot dead in the area. Gangsterism is a serious concern. Some youngsters join gangs because they say there's a lack of opportunities. Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz said he appreciates the community's concerns. "We can't just wait for security companies, we as communities must take safety into our own hands and the footprint of safety must be everyone's responsibility." #YouthDay The Eureka community is calling more youth programmes and wants government to address gang violence in their area.
