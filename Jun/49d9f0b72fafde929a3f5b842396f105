The city said the approval of the programme allowed it to be able to ensure that defaulting customers were brought back into good standing on their municipal accounts. JOHANNESBURG – The City of Johannesburg has approved a debt rehabilitation programme allowing residents to have the arrears on their municipal accounts written off. “Qualifying customers will receive immediate relief through a 50% debt write-off if the customer complies with all the requirements of the programme, which will include keeping their accounts up to date and allowing for regular inspection of metered services, then the remaining outstanding debt will be written off over a three-year period," said City of Johannesburg finance MMC Funzela Ngobeni. The city said the approval of the programme allowed it to be able to ensure that defaulting customers were brought back into good standing on their municipal accounts. Ngobeni said municipal rates and services were left unmanaged and resulted in a large debtor's book and an insurmountable debt burden on residents. He said following the approval of the report, the city would embark on educational roadshows in August with the application process set to start in September. According to the approved report, write-offs were only applicable to residential account holders whose balances were in arrears for more than 90 days as of 30 June.
