JOHANNESBURG - Former Transnet group treasurer Mathane Makgatho on Friday told the state capture inquiry that it was an “open secret” that there was a lot of money moving around in the state-owned company’s head office during the processing of the controversial locomotives tender, which was riddled with fraud and corruption.
