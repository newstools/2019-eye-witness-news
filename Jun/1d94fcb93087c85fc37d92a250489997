JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she has laid a formal complaint with police against people who’ve insulted her in line with the laws governing her office. Speaking at a South African Sheriffs Society event on Friday night, Mkhwebane detailed how she was victimised by the media, government officials and even a minister for carrying out certain investigations. She claimed to be subjected to insults for pursuing the South African Revenue Service rogue unit case and for issuing the report on Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The public protector has been in office for twenty months and has faced criticism for her handling of various matters involving high ranking politicians, with some of her decisions overturned by the courts. She claims that she has been called an “idiot” by a journalist and was told she is too forward by a government DG. The public protector said she is being victimised for conducting investigations into the Sars rogue unit and for recommending that Absa pay back to the state R1 billion for receiving an irregular payment from the reserve bank during apartheid. Mkhwebane said she enforced provisions in the Public Protector Act to take against those who have wronged her. She said the victimisation against her has left her fearing for her life. She also dismissed suggestions that her choice of investigations is influenced by African National Congress factional fights. Mkhwebane’s timing of the release of a report that found that Gordhan had not acted in line with the Constitution just ahead of the elections was viewed by some as an attempt to get him left out of the Cabinet.
