Two of the suspects’ alleged accomplices were fatally shot by police following a high-speed chase. In their endeavour to evade arrest, they sped through an intersection and collided with three other vehicles. Seven people, including a child, were injured. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate says officers fired eight shots at the car after one of the men tried to stab a policeman. The suspects reportedly hijacked the vehicle, believed to be a taxi, in Bellville on Thursday afternoon.
