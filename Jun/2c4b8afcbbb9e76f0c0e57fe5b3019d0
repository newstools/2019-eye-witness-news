JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was planning to challenge the court ruling in its dispute against former Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in the Supreme Court of Appeal.

Two months ago, the EFF accused Manuel  - who sat on the panel that appointed  Edward Kieswetter as Sars commissioner - of having close business ties to him.
