He is facing charges of incitement of violence and damage to public property. Ndzongana claims former Western Cape Helen Zille premier is behind his arrest. “It was political,” he said of his arrest. “The pressure that I was supposed to be arrested came directly from the former premier of the Western Cape, which is Helen Zille, and also the minister of police; but particularly it came directly from the premier of the Western Cape,” he said.
