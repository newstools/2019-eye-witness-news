The baby girl who was snatched from her sleeping mother during visiting hours on Thursday was found unharmed in Diepkloof on Friday morning. JOHANNESBURG - A 35-year-old Soweto woman has been taken in for questioning after a baby was kidnapped from the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. The baby girl who was snatched from her sleeping mother during visiting hours on Thursday was found unharmed in Diepkloof on Friday morning. Police said the breakthrough followed a tip-off from community members. Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said the suspect entered the hospital posing as the baby’s grandmother. “She told the nurses that she was the grandmother or the mother-in-law of the patient, and she was taking the baby to see the uncles outside,” Masuku said. CCTV footage showed a middle-aged woman exiting with the baby. However, police said the suspect in custody was not the woman in question.
