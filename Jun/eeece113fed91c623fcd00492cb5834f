IFP chief whip, Narend Singh, said they were offered the position by the African National Congress because of the party's tough stance against corruption CAPE TOWN - Inkhatha Freedom Party (IFP) MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa is the new chairperson of Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). The committee is essentially the guardian of the public purse. IFP chief whip Narend Singh said they were offered the position by the African National Congress (ANC) because of the party's tough stance against corruption. “We are very honoured that the IFP was considered for that post and we believe that is the result of the way we’ve conducted ourselves as a party that stands for no corruption. We're a party with integrity and a party that leader Buthelezi has guided us to doing the right thing all the time.” The ANC confirmed earlier this week that the chairmanship of Parliament’s public finance watchdog would go to the IFP but didn’t say which member would occupy the seat. The Scopa chairperson position was occupied by African People’s Convention’s Themba Godi for the last two terms of parliament. But Godi, who was highly rated by all parties as the chairman, failed to make it back to Parliament after his party’s dismal performance at the elections. Hlengwa was no stranger to the committee, serving as a member for five years. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
