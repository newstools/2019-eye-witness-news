She said the incident happened after a woman threatened her while she was standing in a queue. “And then her son came and said ‘f#tsek’ in my face, I asked him what gives him the right to say that and he said because I’m black.” V&A Waterfront's Donald Kau said they were investigating the matter. “We are aware of the incident. We have contacted Van Damme to get her account of the incident and we will also be looking at the actions of the security manager on the scene and that of the family individuals that were involved.” WATCH: DA’s Phumzile van Damme punches alleged racist at V&A Waterfront
