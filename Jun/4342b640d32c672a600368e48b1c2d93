EFF leader Julius Malema made the comments at the party elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has addressed the crowd after appearing in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Friday. He was in court on charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956 for saying party members must occupy land; he made the comments at the party elective conference in Bloemfontein back in 2014. Malema said: "Justice must be served, and justice is the return of the land. There is no justice without the return of the land. It does not matter whether that land was bought, if you bought it, you too bought stolen land and anytime rightful owners will arrive to claim theirs." He added that "they have charged us for saying the land must be restored to its rightful owners". The red berets leader also thanked the party's supporters for coming out to support him ad he appeared in court. The National Prosecuting Authority charged him with contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956. WATCH: Malema reiterates calls for occupation of land  His case has been postponed to 8 November this year. Malema faced a similar charge for making similar comments in KwaZulu-Natal in 2016 and that case has been postponed to 8 of July.
