In 2009, the Eastern Cape High Court sentenced Dalindyebo to 15 years in jail for kidnapping, assault and other charges. JOHANNESBURG - The AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo has on Monday morning been released from prison. In 2009, the Eastern Cape High Court sentenced Dalindyebo to 15 years in jail for kidnapping, assault and other charges. The Supreme Court of Appeal then reduced his sentence by three years. He began serving his prison term in 2015. His release has been confirmed by justice and correctional services spokesperson Chrispin Phiri. “Kind Dalindyebo has followed due process and has been released on parole accordingly. In light of remissions, his sentence will be reduced by one year. This means he’s out on parole and is under the guidance of the community services section of the Department of Correctional Services.” But Phiri couldn't provide details about the parole conditions that have been put in place for the king. “We’re not at liberty to comment on the conditions that have been; they are conditions that are set between the parole board and the offender.” Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he had granted a special remission of sentences to prisoners and those out on parole but those who committed sexual offences would not qualify. Dalindyebo is one of those prisoners who were granted the special remission - meaning his sentence was reduced by 12 months.
