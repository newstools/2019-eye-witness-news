Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu retained their positions as president and deputy president respectively, the rest of the new EFF leadership is completely new. JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters’s (EFF) founder Julius Malema has retained his position as president of the party after he was nominated unopposed on Saturday. The six-year-old organisation is holding its national elective conference at Nasrec near Soweto. Three thousand delegates appointed the new top six leaders on Saturday night. While Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu  retained their positions as president and deputy president respectively, the rest of the new EFF leadership is completely new. Former national chair advocate Dali Mpofu, who Malema had previously criticised for being over committed, failed to make the cut even after he was nominated for the position of deputy president. He further rejected a second nomination for the position of national chair, which is now occupied by EFF Member of Parliament (MP) Veronica Mente.   Head of the institute of Election Management Service in AfricaTerry Tselane also delivered a devastating blow to Mpofu - which demonstrates that his popularity in the party has waned. “The candidature of a nominee to succeed, you must get 30% or, in numbers, 954. Advocate Dali Mpofu has not been able to cross the threshold.” Meanwhile, another MP Marshall Dlamini has been appointed secretary general of the organisation – replacing Godrich Gardee.   Dlamini will be deputised by Poppy Mailola.   Former Gauteng treasurer Omphile Maotwe was nominated unopposed for the position of national treasurer.
