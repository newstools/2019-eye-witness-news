Any effort by the City to minimise the impact of load shedding must be commended. We understand that the exemption is because there are key installations in the city centre… big businesses, parliament, the provincial parliament, the City of Cape Town itself, a couple of hospitals… We haven’t heard from our members any sense of unfairness…  The City of Cape Town can isolate even a single building [to exclude from load shedding]… When you do that on a larger scale, it’s relatively easy in the CBD – lots of businesses and people... logistics prevent the City from doing it [exempting large areas outside the CBD]…  The City of Cape Town has done a great deal more than most municipalities to mitigate the risk that load shedding causes for businesses… When we had stage-2 load shedding in the country, the City of Cape Town brought it down to Stage-1 because it had its own generation…  We anticipate that the situation at Eskom is going to deteriorate.
