WATCH: How Eskom’s illegal electricity syndicates operate  As the new year approaches, Eskom has no intentions of giving Soweto a fresh start when it comes to its electricity debt. With the sluggish economy, everyone is feeling the pinch and Soweto residents are using this to explain why they can’t pay up. “Some of us are unemployed and unable to pay for electricity,” said one resident. “The Freedom Charter refers to free basic services for all, which electricity is included,” another resident added. But Eskom also said it had no money and was struggling to keep the lights on. The utility’s Daphne Mokwena said: “These meters are being by-passed by the customers and we don’t have the full view or access over our meters.” It remains to be seen how this battle will be resolved.
