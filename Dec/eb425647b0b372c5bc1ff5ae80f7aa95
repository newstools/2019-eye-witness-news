The Labour Court ruled on Friday that the city was in contempt of court for not obeying an order to reinstate a fired employee. JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing Tshwane acting city manager Moeketsi Ntsimane faces three months in prison if the city doesn't comply with a court order this week. The Labour Court ruled on Friday that the city was in contempt of court for not obeying an order to reinstate a fired employee. Acting Mayor Abel Tau said the matter first went to court before Ntsimane was appointed to the position. But he might be jailed in his personal capacity because the ruling came in the last three months that he was in office. The city’s Abel Tau said: “The city has been found by the High Court to not have obliged with the order of the court in relation to an employee of the city. We have been ordered that they may return to work based on the statutory requirements. Subsequent to that, there is an order that if she is not allowed to get back to work, then the accounting officer faces two to three months imprisonment.”
