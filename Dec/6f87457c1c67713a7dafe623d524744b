CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City captain Thamsanqa Mkhize said the players responded positively to the new coach philosophy. Jan Olde Riekerink was appointed last month, replacing sacked Benni McCarthy. The new mentor has since played two matches at the helm, conceding zero goals coming back with two after two draws. The 11th place City will face another league strugglers Chippa United on Saturday at Athlone Stadium. The Port Elizabeth-based side are sitting in 16th position with 11 points after 16 matches. Mkhize said playing Chippa was never an easy task. "They've always caused us problems whenever we play against them. Again we will focus on us as Cape Town City because the most important part on the day is to believe in ourselves and win the game," said Mkhize. "I won't lie we are adapting and responding positively and we are believing in the process that we are going through with the coach. We respect him and we are willing to give him every respect as players." This week Premier Soccer League confirmed the Citizen attacking midfielder Thabo Nodada's solo goal against Orlando Pirates has been selected as the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month for September/October 2019. The 31-year-old Durban-born player opened up about the difficulties players faced after the announcement that McCarthy would no longer be the coach. "To be honest, in the beginning, it was difficult and also us as players we were trying to process the fact that our head coach was gone. But also us as professional players we need to adapt to the new coach, respect him and do what's best for the team."
