CAPE TOWN - The much anticipated Cape Town leg of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series is currently under way at Cape Town Stadium. The tournament will for the first feature women's teams who have kicked off proceedings for the three-day tournament. Fans from all over the world have come in their numbers, sporting colourful costumes. Supporters said that being in Cape Town was an amazing feeling and they would do anything to support Imbokodo and the Blitzboks. "I reckon that being in Cape Town is a brilliant experience as I haven't been here for a long time. It's a beautiful stadium. I live in Durban and I haven't even been to the Moses Mabhida Stadium but I've come to Cape Town," one supporter said. "This is my first time at the Sevens here in Cape Town and I'm so far enjoying every minute and we're here for all three days and I'm loving it. So far the atmosphere has been brilliant but probably tomorrow and Sunday it's going to be even better," another supported said.
