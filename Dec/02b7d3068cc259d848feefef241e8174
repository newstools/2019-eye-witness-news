Malema said he was aware of what he called the escalating disdain when it came to how journalists report about the EFF. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has questioned the role of journalists who cover stories about the country's third-largest political party. Malema said he was aware of what he called the escalating disdain when it came to how journalists report about the EFF. He was addressing over 3,000 EFF members on Saturday attending the three-day elective conference, which commenced on Friday, at Nasrec.

The tv news broadcaster said it had done this in solidarity with some media organisations including the Daily Maverick that have been banned from covering the party's congress. eNCA's editor-in-chief Jeremy Maggs said: “I find it regrettable that the channel is not going to bring news of the event. We believe that we have to take a firm stand on media freedom by showing a degree of solidarity.” At the same time, the Daily Maverick has described the move as an enforceable sanction. The investigative media outlet said the ban was against the spirit of a new, democratic South Africa. The EFF said it couldn't distribute media access to all journalists due to lack of capacity.

The publication said it intended on approaching the courts next year over the issue. WATCH: Daily Maverick is
