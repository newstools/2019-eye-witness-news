No one opposed it and no one abstained. 110 councillors voted in support of the motion of no confidence against her. TSHWANE - The Tshwane Council voted out the Democratic Alliance (DA)  Speaker of council Katlego Mathebe on Thursday night. African National Congress and Economic Freedom Fighters councillors voted in the motion, saying the speaker failed in her duties About 110 councillors voted in support of the motion of no confidence against her. The next process is the motion of no confidence in Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Tshwane treasurer Obakeng Ramabodu was appointed as the acting speaker and presided over the motion against Mathebe. The DA has indicated it will challenge the special council decision in court, saying the processes followed to remove the speaker were flawed. DA councillors did not participate in the motion against its speaker. The party's Gauteng leader, John Moody, said what happened in council was a clear coup and unlawful. “What has happened here, including the deputy director-general of Cogta go up and take the seat for an acting speaker, was illegal.” 'RAMABODU, REMOVE YOURSELF, ILLEGAL ALIEN' The DA has rejected the election of Ramabodu as acting speaker, calling it illegal. One of the DA's councillors said Ramabodu was an illegal speaker. “Remove yourself. Remove yourself, illegal alien,” said the councillor.
