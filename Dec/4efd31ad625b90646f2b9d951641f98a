DURBAN - A 31-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Umbumbulu Magistrate Court on Tuesday for allegedly killing his girlfriend.

KZN police said her body was covered in bruises and stab wounds. This was the latest in a number of attacks on women in the past few weeks, despite initiatives from government to stop gender-based violence. KZN police told Eyewitness News that Chiliza was stabbed multiple times. It is believed the victim and the suspect had an argument after returning from a local tavern in the early hours of Sunday morning. The suspect allegedly accused Chiliza of cheating on him and attacked her. Later on Sunday afternoon, the suspect called Chilizaâ€™s sister to notify her that Chiliza had died.
