Ethiopian Airlines has bucked the trend, providing a model that others hope to emulate. NAIROBI/JOHANNESBURG - Governments from Kenya to South Africa are struggling to turn around loss-making state-owned airlines through restructuring or by bringing on board private partners. Ethiopian Airlines has bucked the trend, providing a model that others hope to emulate. Following is a summary of the financial position of major African airlines: SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS State-owned South African Airways (SAA) has not made a profit since 2011. It has made losses of more than 5 billion rand ($340 million) for each of the past three financial years, according to company documents reviewed by Reuters. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed the government to put SAA into a business rescue - South Africa’s form of bankruptcy protection - after an eight-day strike in November left it close to collapse. He said on Monday it was the “only way to secure its survival”.
