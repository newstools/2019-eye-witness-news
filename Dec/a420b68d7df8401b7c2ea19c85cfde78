The first day of the party’s elective conference was dominated by its outgoing leader Julius Malema’s political report, which painted a picture of a party that still has a lot of work ahead. SOWETO - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has on Saturday called on its members to exercise political discipline if they want the formation to grow stronger beyond its six years of existence. The first day of the party’s elective conference was dominated by its outgoing leader Julius Malema’s political report, which painted a picture of a party that still has a lot of work ahead. As Malema tabled to the conference a reflection of the past five years in the EFF since its founding conference in 2014, he detailed successes achieved in this period, including the campaign for the nationalisation of land and the South African Reserve Bank. Malema, however, warned delegates that all these policy perspectives and the organisation’s history would be rendered meaningless if EFF is not rooted in discipline. It is discipline that will allow us to build a socialist vanguard.” “It is discipline that will make the EFF a viable alternative for the hopeless masses of our people. An alternative that will maintain its protest character while fighting battles within the walls of Parliament. Malema has also described some members of society who regard the EFF as a fascist organisation as intellectually lazy. “A fascist organisation will not conduct a democratic elective and policy conference within its own ranks where members decide on party policy and elect their preferred leaders.” Delegates will be nominating and electing top six officials on Saturday evening.
