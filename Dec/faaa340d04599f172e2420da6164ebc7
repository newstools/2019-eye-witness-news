We will want them in plainclothes from time to time walking or just being around the mountain as well as our regular mugging hot spots around the mountain so that we can intercept that,” he said. He added that there were also other law enforcement teams in the city who were doing patrols on the streets and beaches as well. Winde said the e-bicycles would help officers to cover greater distances to ensure visitor safety. “It's about safety across the board, it doesn’t matter where you are in the city. There are different parts of the city that have different needs and this is one of the needs, especially during the tourist season,” Winde said.
