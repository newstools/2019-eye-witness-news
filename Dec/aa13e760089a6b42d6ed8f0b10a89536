Standard Bank announced that it will not sponsor the Proteas beyond 2020. The issues bubbling under at CSA came to a head last Sunday when five journalists had their accreditation revoked after the organisation claimed they were writing stories that painted it in an unfavourable light. While the accreditation has seen been reinstated, the damage appears to have been done. Two independent board directors Iqbal Khan and Shirley Zinn have resigned this week. Three officials – including Moroe and former acting chief financial officer Ziyanda Nkuta – have now been suspended. CSA’s board will hold a special board meeting on Saturday.
