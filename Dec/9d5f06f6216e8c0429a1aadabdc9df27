DURBAN - A 29-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Monday on a charge of kidnapping. The police said a two-year-old child was kidnapped last Thursday at a shopping mall in Umhlanga.

She reported the man to the mall management who then contacted the police. Police spokesperson Jay Naicker said: “Police officers from Durban north arrived at the scene and viewed the CCTV footage at the mall. The suspect was immediately identified as a security guard who was on duty at the mall and he was promptly arrested.” Naicker said the motive for the crime was not yet clear, but police were investigating.
