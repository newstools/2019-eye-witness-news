Delegates at the gathering are discussing how social dialogue and gender equality can lead to the realisation of the ILO’s decent work agenda and the United Nations' sustainable development goals. ABIDJAN - Experts addressing the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) regional meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, say strong labour market institutions are essential for the implementation of set international standards. Delegates at the gathering are discussing how social dialogue and gender equality can lead to the realisation of the ILO’s decent work agenda and the United Nations' sustainable development goals. The organisation’s decent work agenda integrates several programmes in pursuit of full, productive employment and decent work for all. The gathering has been reflecting on the strides made by ILO member states in achieving this, with delegates saying there was still a long way to go for many states across the continent as work had in some cases become more precarious. University of Cape Town professor Evance Kalula said social dialogue platforms such as South Africa’s Nedlac could ensure the implementation of policies which would increase labour market participation and inclusion. “Governance is key; it needs to be transparent, have a sense of ownership of not only the players but of the beneficiaries as well outside the labour market. So, labour markets are important in that sense.” Business Unity South Africa’s Kaizer Moyane - who was on the panel interrogating the issue - agreed with Kalula. Moyane said social partners, which comprise government, labour, employers and community, were able to hold each other accountable on commitments and conventions agreed to on the international stage - as opposed to when there were no strong labour market institutions.
