The MEC for Finance Maruping Lekwene gazetted extended operating hours in the Sol Plaatjie Municipality from the 9 to 11 January. JOHANNESBURG - The Northern Cape government has bowed to pressure from the African National Congress Women’s League and revoked a decision to allow liquor stores to remain open 24 hours a day during the ANC’s 8 January celebrations. The MEC for Finance Maruping Lekwene gazetted extended operating hours in the Sol Plaatjie Municipality from the 9 to 11 January. The women’s league did not take kindly to this, accusing the province of reducing the celebrations to a drinking spree. Lekwene has now reversed that decision. “We’re taking note of it. As a province, we’re have heeded the call from national leadership.”
