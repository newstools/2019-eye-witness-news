She takes over from acting provincial commissioner Sindile Mfazi. CAPE TOWN - Lieutenant-General Yolisa Matakata has become the first female provincial police commissioner in the Western Cape. Police Minister Bheki Cele made the announcement in Pretoria on Thursday. The Western Cape has been without a permanent police commissioner for the past three months. Matakata has spent the past 34 years in the police service. She rose to the higher echelons when former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula appointed her as acting head of the Hawks to replace Berning Ntlemeza in 2017. That appointment followed a High Court ruling that Ntlemeza had lied under oath and lacked integrity. Matakata held the position for just over a year until Godfrey Lebeya was appointed in May 2018. She has also headed up the Hawks in the Western Cape before returning to her role as deputy national commissioner of the elite crime-fighting unit. Matakata joined the police in 1995 and spent 15 years working in Crime Intelligence in her home province of the Western Cape. Her appointed has been widely welcomed.
