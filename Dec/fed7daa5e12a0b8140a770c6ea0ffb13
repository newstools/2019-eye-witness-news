"We welcome the withdrawal of eNCA in all our events. No one must go back to report and say we banned eNCA. They withdrew from the conference, meaning they withdrew from covering the EFF. So, if that is going to be their attitude, then they must bring it on.” In his political report to the conference earlier, Malema spoke at length about what he said were enemy forces which use the media and state institutions to persecute the eff leadership. In his view, eNCA's decision came about after he attacked multi-billionaire, Johan Rupert. “They cut the feed and used an excuse but it’s Johan, once you take him on, he takes his initiatives to fight back by closing people’s accounts and cuts people off the media because he owns the media.” Malema also mentioned that this was not the first time the EFF had been at loggerheads with the media, citing its disassociation from the now-defunct ANN7 as an example.
