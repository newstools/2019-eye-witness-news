Pitso Mosimane added to his glorious history at the club on Saturday as he led the team to a 2-1 win over Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout final at Moses Mabhida Stadium. JOHANNESBURG - Pitso Mosimane has on Tuesday revealed that the next contract extension that he will sign at Mamelodi Sundowns will be his last in top-flight football. Mosimane added to his glorious history at the club on Saturday as he led the team to a 2-1 win over Maritzburg United in the Telkom Knockout final at Moses Mabhida Stadium.  Seven years on from first joining the club, Mosimane is in talks about a third contract extension, with his current deal due to expire at the end of this season. “It's the very first time I'm in this position, I've never been in this position before,” he said after the final. “I've been here for seven years, I've had two contracts and it was never an issue. I've always signed any time and any day. I don't think you have ever heard me before stealing a contract, but I'm 55 and want to go until 60. This is too stressful for me, I can't be having this stress all the time, so it's my last contract and I think it must be worth it.” Mosimane added that the love shown to him by supporters makes him want to stay. “I'm here, I love Mamelodi Sundowns, Sundowns loves me, they want me to stay, I want to stay, and the team has also approached me and said 'coach, we want you to stay' so we love each other,” he said. “It's a matter ofhugs and all that. We haven't reached an agreement. We were talking but we haven't reached an agreement so there's no rush, especially when you all want to be together.” Sundowns face Bidvest Wits in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday night, looking to close the gap on log leaders Kaizer Chiefs. The Glamour Boys enjoy a 10-point lead at the top of the table but Sundowns have a game in hand.
