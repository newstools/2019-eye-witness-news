ESKOM IN CRISIS Eskom  on Tuesday said it was in a better position with generating capacity, but heavy rain in Mpumalanga was still impacting its coal supply. The power utility implemented stage four load shedding on Tuesday morning, down from stage six on Monday. • What stage 6 (and 7 & 8) load shedding means  Eskom COO Jan Oberholzer  said the parastatal stockpiled on emergency supplies, like water and diesel, overnight and things were looking better. But South Africans were nowhere near out of the woods. The heavy rain and its effect on coal continued to hamper electricity output. Oberholzer said they were working hard to mitigate the burden on consumers. “We are still in excess of a 1,000 MW because of the rain, as it is still raining in Mpumalanga, where the majority of our coal power plant is situated. It looks much better than yesterday.” Tuesday’s load shedding was expected to continue until 11 pm.
