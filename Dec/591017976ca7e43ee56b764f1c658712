Children who arrive at beaches will be registered and issued with an identification armband. During the festive season last year, more than 100,000 children were tagged at beaches, a 132% increase on the previous year. Mayco member for Community Services and Health Zahid Badroodien said 535 children were reunited with their families. “It provides peace of mind to parents on busy beach days when children can easily become lost in a crowd. It also helps to reunite children faster with their families.” The Identikidz project will be implemented at the following beaches: Muizenberg, Fish Hoek, Strandfontein, Gordon’s Bay, Strand, Monwabisi, Harmony Park, Mnandi, Big Bay, Sea Point and the surrounding area, Silwerstroom, Camps Bay, Lagoon Beach, Melkbosstrand, Milnerton Beach.
