Her name will now be sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa for his consideration. CAPE TOWN - The National Assembly has endorsed advocate Kholeka Gcaleka as the next deputy Public Protector. Her name will now be sent to President Cyril Ramaphosa for his consideration. Gcaleka is set to replace Kevin Malunga, whose term expires next week on 9 December. While the African National Congress defended Gcaleka as their favoured candidate, the Democratic Alliance,  as well as the African Christian Democratic Party and the United Democratic Movement, were opposed. After being deferred earlier because there weren’t enough ANC MPs in the House, Wednesday afternoon's vote went 203 in favour and 103 against, with no abstentions. UNFIT FOR THE JOB The DA’s Glynnis Breytenbach said Gcaleka was unfit for the job having backed disgraced former NPA head Menzi Simelane and continuing to work for former minister Malusi Gigaba after he was found to have lied under oath. “The Public Protector herself leaves much to be desired. It is no secret that the DA has never supported her. To send another person of questionable ethics where integrity should be unquestionable is just compounding the problem.” The EFF’s Noluvuyo Tafeni accused the ANC of using its majority to impose Gcaleka, saying it made a mockery of the office. The ACDP and UDM were also opposed. But the ANC’s Hishaam Mohamed stoutly defended Gcaleka, claiming the allegations against her were baseless. “Advocate Gcaleka’s track record and qualifications certainly indicate she not only fits the requirement for the post of Deputy Public Protector, but she will also excel in it.”
