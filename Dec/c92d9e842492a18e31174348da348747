Harry Kane followed up his own shot to equalise in the 53rd minute and cancel out Adam Webster’s first-half header. LONDON - Tottenham Hotspur’s Harry Kane and Dele Alli scored in the second half as Jose Mourinho’s side came from behind to claim a 2-1 home victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Thursday. Kane followed up his own shot to equalise in the 53rd minute and cancel out Adam Webster’s first-half header and Alli put Spurs ahead in the 72nd, knocking in a pass from Serge Aurier to complete a move inspired by substitute Christian Eriksen. Spurs were reeling from a disheartening home 2-0 loss to Chelsea and a sleepy atmosphere gripped their stadium early in the game, which was briefly lifted when Kane put the ball in the net before a VAR review ruled the effort offside. Brighton, who had thrashed Spurs 3-0 in October in one of the final games under Mourinho’s predecessor Mauricio Pochettino, went ahead when defender Webster appeared unmarked to head in a Pascal Gross free kick in the 37th minute. Mourinho left club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele out of the squad but brought on Giovani Lo Celso and Eriksen after Kane’s leveller and the move paid off as Eriksen foxed Brighton’s defence with a cross-field pass which Aurier flicked to Alli. The victory took Tottenham up to fifth in the standings on 29 points after 19 games and left Brighton in 13th on 20.
