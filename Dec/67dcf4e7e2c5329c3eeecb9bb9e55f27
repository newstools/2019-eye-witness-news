Someone just broke Nic Dlaminiâ€™s arm pic.twitter.com/oYQGiTNUPM  SANParks' Ray Tlakudi said that they're trying to establish the facts. "We heard that he entered gate 1 of the Silvermine section of Table Mountain National Park without paying the conservation fee. The rangers were then made aware of the situation and on approaching him, he became quite aggressive. They tried to arrest him and get him into the bakkie. But we only have the rangers' side of the story and we'll wait for him to recover to get his side of the story as well."
