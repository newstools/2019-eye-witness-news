Delegates from Limpopo province, which has the majority of members at this national people’s convention, are leading the choruses of struggle songs. JOHANNESBURG – Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is expected to open the party’s second national elective conference at Nasrec near Soweto on Saturday morning. The organisation that almost doubled its presence in parliament following the May elections will – among others – spend the long weekend taking stock of its growth since its 2014 conference. Delegates from Limpopo province, which has the majority of members at this national people’s convention, are leading the choruses of struggle songs being belted out in the hall as people trickle in ahead of the official start of the programme.   At the same time, other red berets could be heard singing what has come to be described as slate songs praising their ideal candidates for the contested leadership positions.   Voting for top six leaders will take place on Saturday night. However, before that, Malema will present his political report to the conference after the singing of the national anthem and inter-faith prayers. Three-thousand-eight-hundred delegates are expected to attend.
