DURBAN - A Durban man accused of kidnapping a two-year-old child at a shopping centre is expected back in the Verulam Magistrates Court on Monday morning. Ntandoyenkosi Bulose made his first court appearance last week where the State revealed that it was investigating his possible involvement with a syndicate. Bulose is expected to apply for bail. CCTV footage emerged on social media showing the man taking the child while the grandmother was paying at a counter.  Bulose faces a charge of kidnapping after he allegedly took the two-year-old child from a trolley at the Crescent Shopping Mall in Umhlanga. He was arrested over a week ago after the child's grandmother reported him to authorities. The incident was captured on camera. At his last court appearance, the State indicated that it would oppose Bulose's bail application. State prosecutor Sabelo Ziqubu told the court that they were looking into previous convictions, pending warrants, and Bulose's possible involvement with a kidnapping syndicate.
