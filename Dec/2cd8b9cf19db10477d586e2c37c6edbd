Kolisi dedicated his World Peace and Sport Champion for 2019 Award, which he received in Monaco, to the 2019 Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok squad. JOHANNESBURG - Springbok captain Siya Kolisi received yet another award on Thursday. Kolisi dedicated his World Peace and Sport Champion for 2019 award, which he received in Monaco, to the 2019 Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok squad. Kolisi led South Africa to the RWC title in Japan at the start of November. “It's a great honour and a privilege for me and it's great to see people recognise people that use their voice and use their platform and do some work off the field as well and it will inspire people to do more,” he said after receiving the award. “We're not just sportsmen. We can do much more off the field.” Kolisi also praised the impact of the Springboks at the tournament in Japan and back home in South Africa and said the momentous win in Japan was a collective effort. "Among my teammates, there are so many other leaders. I don't like taking all the credit because it's not just me, the coaches, the physios, everybody adds value to anything the team achieves." The South African skipper is also a nominee for the prestigious BBC World Sports Star of the Year Award. He is up against golfing great Tiger Woods, road runner Eliud Kipchoge, and former Australian Cricket captain Steve Smith among others.
