The Imbokodo will have six debutantes in their tournament squad of 12 players for the inaugural women’s leg of the Cape Town Sevens taking place at Cape Town Stadium starting on Friday. CAPE TOWN - Springbok Women’s Sevens coach Paul Delport believes that for the girls to be better and mentally stronger, they need to play the best teams in the world. The Imbokodo will have six debutantes in their tournament squad of 12 players for the inaugural women’s leg of the Cape Town Sevens taking place at Cape Town Stadium starting on Friday. The ladies will kick off the tournament against New Zealand on Friday evening. Delport admitted that it was a tough start as New Zealand was consistently among the top three teams in the world and won last weekend in Dubai. "The ladies are super excited that we've got New Zealand up first and it's going to be a massive challenge for us. For us in our journey, we have to play the best teams in the world to get better," said Delport. "We are fine and we have 13 fit players - we were watching Meghan Phillips closely because she played for Tuks last weekend in Dubai and she came through nicely. It's really nice to have full contingency up and the ladies are fully fit."
