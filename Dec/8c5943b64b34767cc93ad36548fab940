CAPE TOWN - The road for recovery and moving away from the relegation zone for Chippa United hasn't been easy but coach Norman Mapeza believes his players are showing positives. The Port Elizabeth based side moved from the 16th spot to the 11th place on Saturday after the much-needed win against Cape Town City at Athlone Stadium. A first-half goal from striker Augustine Kwem was enough to get the Chilli Boys out of the danger zone. Mapeza said desire and results at training were positive. "When I arrived here I think two months ago, I knew the situation at the club - I thought let me take the challenge, let me learn these boys not taking away anything from other coaches. Those coaches did well, surviving relegation here not easy," said Mapeza. "The results have been positive in terms of the desire at training and I can tell you now that every day, they are willing to learn, they are willing to push. "For me as the coach, those are the positives that when you go home leaving the training knowing that these players are willing to learn and willing to push." The former Zimbabwean defender was appointed as a coach on a three-year contract replacing caretaker coach Duran Francisâ€š who was fired. Mapeza said although they didn't have their key players, getting three points in Cape Town was a huge achievement. "We don't have big numbers, we have a small squad - some guys were not available. The likes of Lerato [Manzini] who lost his father; so it shows you that we are a small team. We had two players from the MDC team," he said. "I hope come January, we will show more positives."
