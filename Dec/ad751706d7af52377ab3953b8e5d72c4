The cartoon has caused heated debate on Twitter. It depicts a conversation between a white person - who is accused of taking land - while a black man is accused of rape. Both deny being involved in either instance.    She said the cartoonist was trying to make a point, highlighting how the two races were stereotyped. "The most basic reading of that cartoon will show you that the cartoon is rejecting the stereotypes. He [the cartoonist] is undermining the stereotypes, he's laughing at the stereotypes, he's using satire to debunk the stereotypes."
