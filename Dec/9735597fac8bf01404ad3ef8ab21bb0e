JOHANNESBURG - Jacques Faul has been appointed as the interim CEO of Cricket South Africa (CSA) after Thabang Moroe  was suspended from his duties on Friday. The announcement was made at a media briefing in Johannesburg on Saturday. Faul is the current CEO of the Titans and is no stranger to CSA, having been interim CEO in 2012 after replacing Gerald Majola. CSA President Chris Nenzani also said that Graeme Smith  agreed in principle to be CSA’s first-ever Director of Cricket. A formal contract was set to be signed on Wednesday. “If you have your Director of Cricket in place then your selection process is going to kick in and then the team can begin to prepare properly. The way we have structured this role we do not want a situation whether this person is not having input on who is part of the selection panel”, he said. Nenzani also said that Moroe’s suspension would not be longer than six months, but that a report would determine how quickly matters get concluded. “When I spoke to him, he did not even think for a moment, he said I will come in to lend my support and put my shoulders on the wheel for the benefit of cricket in the country”, he said. Despite criticism of the board, Nenzani said they were given a vote of confidence by the Members Council and there would not be any more resignations. It’s been a stormy week for CSA with Standard Bank pulling out as a sponsor after Moroe admitted to withdrawing the accreditation of journalists critical of the governing body. Nenzani also said that former International Cricket Council CEO Dave Richardson would be of assistance to Faul regarding any matter of need. “This gives us stability at management level and in leadership, you should not allow a vacuum to occur”, he said.
