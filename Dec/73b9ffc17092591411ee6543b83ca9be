Tiro Holele will now head the bus wing of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). JOHANNESBURG - Autopax has appointed a new interim CEO as the company battles to balance its books. Tiro Holele will now head the bus wing of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Last month, workers' salaries were delayed by a week because of the cashflow problems. Holele is now Autopax’s acting CEO as the company tries to get its house in order. Ranti Mahlabana, who held the fort before Holele’s appointment, said they hoped there won’t be another delay in the payment of salaries. "I think the number of measures we are putting into place would really assist us to ensure that we don't find ourselves in the same situation. We are involving all the employees, we are involving the unions in terms of being able to say how do you ensure that Autopax becomes a financially viable business." In December last year, Autopax drivers went to strike over a pay dispute, disrupting operations and leaving thousands of travellers stranded. It is expected that salaries will be paid in full on Friday but if this does not happen, unions have threatened to escalate the matter. City to City and Translux services could be affected.
