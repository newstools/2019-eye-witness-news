Despite the draw not helping them in their quest to chase down Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was happy with the point his side secured against Wits under tough circumstances. JOHANNESBURG - Gavin Hunt believes there is still a long way to go in the title race for Kaizer Chiefs to be declared favorites for the Absa Premiership crown. This after Hunt's Wits side played out a 1-1 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday night. Gaston Sirino opened the scoring in the 15th minute for the Brazilians but a Gift Motupa header on the stroke of halftime ensured that the game ended in a draw. The result means that Chiefs lead at the top shrinks to 9 points, with Sundowns in second place. Wits can also not be ruled out of the race as they are 14 points behind but have three games in hand. “I don’t think this draw helped,” Hunt said after the game at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. “We are two, maybe one, of the challengers…you know, this doesn’t help anybody... us or Sundowns… ten games, it’s a long, long way to go”. Pitso Mosimane has also echoed that sentiment, as he believes that Wits’ campaign in the CAF Confed Cup has made them mentally tougher and harder opponents to beat in the league. “(Golden Arrows assistant coach) Mandla Ncikazi said it, in an article he said: ‘Don’t take Wits for granted and say they are coming from where they are, and they are tired’. You saw what happened and it was a very difficult pitch, heavy pitch but they are showing they are tigers these guys." Despite the draw not helping them in their quest to chase down Chiefs, Mosimane was happy with the point his side secured under tough circumstances. “I can take a point,” he said after the clash which came less than three days after they won the Telkom Knockout final against Maritzburg United. “It’s a point. It’s a good point. Who plays Bidvest Wits and says that ‘I’m going to win’ unless you are arrogant or disrespectful? They are a good team.”
