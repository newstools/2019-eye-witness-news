There were chaotic scenes in the council chamber on Thursday afternoon after Mathebe recused herself from presiding over a motion of no confidence against her. JOHANNESBURG/TSHWANE - Opposition parties in Tshwane have called on speaker Katlego Mathebe to preside over proceedings on Thursday afternoon so that she can be voted out along with Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. There were chaotic scenes in the council chamber after Mathebe recused herself from presiding over a motion of no confidence against herself. Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members refused to accept this and rushed to the podium, confronting the deputy mayor. The EFF and the Democratic Alliance want Mokgalapa out, saying he is failing residents. Just recently, a recording surfaced implicating the mayor and now former MMC Sheila Senkubuge. The clip, circulated on social media, purports to be a conversation between the pair and supposedly includes an intimate exchange between them. The African National Congress' (ANC) Kgosi Maepa said they would not back down until the speaker returns and only after she and the mayor have been voted out would they announce their candidates. “The African National Congress has not come to that decision as yet. What we have come to is a decision to work with other parties to eliminate the speaker and to eliminate and vote out the disgraced executive mayor.” He added other parties would be supporting the ANC: “So, after this council, we’ll go consult with all the parties, because it’s not only the ANC that is voting today. We are working with the PAC and we are working with the EFF.” Councillors have now taken a break to discuss the matter further.
