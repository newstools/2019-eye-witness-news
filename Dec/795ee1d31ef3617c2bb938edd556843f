Eskom has announced it's introducing stage 2 load shedding. It will be implemented from 4pm until 11pm today. CAPE TOWN - Eskom announced that it will implement stage 2 load shedding from 4pm until 11pm on Thursday. In a short statement on Twitter, the power company said it was implementing load shedding "due to a shortage of capacity".  Last week, Eskom said it needed to come up with a way to address the R50 billion shortfall it had accumulated this past financial year. The power utility projected that it would lose R20 billion by the end of the year. Its operating costs are over R30 billion. Eskom's CFO Calib Cassim said it was getting harder to service its debt and a plan is needed. “As we move down the timeline and we embed those savings, that part will reduce based on what Eskom can contribute to the party. “ The cash-strapped state-owned enterprise's board chairperson, Jabu Mabuza, said the power utility’s debt still stood at roughly R454 billion.
