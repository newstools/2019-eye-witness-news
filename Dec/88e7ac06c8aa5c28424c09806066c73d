Malema was nominated unopposed by delegates at the party’s elective national conference at Nasrec on Saturday night. While addressing reporters on Sunday afternoon, a spirited Malema credited the decision of EFF members on his character –  describing himself as a visionary and hard worker. “I don’t take anything for granted. You give it to me; I will work on it and perfect. I pay attention to the smallest detail. I know everything that is happening in this conference. Even if you want to hate me, you will come to accept that ‘it doesn’t matter what we think of him.” Malema says he is not a dictator. “I am not a dicator, I work hard. I come from nothing.” WATCH: EFF leader Julius Malema and his newly elected Top 6 address media
