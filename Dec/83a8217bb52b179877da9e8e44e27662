The parastatal said it understood that South Africans were frustrated because of load shedding, saying rotational blackouts were necessary in order to avoid a national breakdown of its power grid.  Eskom spokesperson Dikatso Mothae said they were doing everything they could to fix the problem. “Power station units had not been maintained over time, which is why they are not operating optimally and we are now at a point where we are having this recovery plan that will take time to see the full benefits of that plan,” she said.
