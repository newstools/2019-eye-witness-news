Emiliano Tade joined Mamelodi Sundowns in January 2019 from AmaZulu. JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns have confirmed they have parted ways with Emiliano Tade less than a year after he joined the club. In a statement on their website, the club says the player approached it to end their working relationship after suffering from persistent injury problems since joining in January. "Mamelodi Sundownsâ€™ Argentine forward Emiliano Tade approached the club to be released from his contract and the club has conceded after the player cited personal reasons," the statement read.  "Tade joined Mamelodi Sundowns earlier this year in January 2019 and was unfortunate to sustain an injury shortly after he joined Sundowns which hampered his progress to cement a place in the squad. He featured in a handful of games for the Absa Premiership Champions but unfortunately, the player sustained a few other niggling injuries which have kept him off the field."
