The 49-year old German joins on a three-year deal. Orlando Pirates have on Tuesday announced the appointment of Josef Zinnbauer as their new coach and a replacement for Micho Sredojević. The 49-year old German joins on a three-year deal. Chairman Dr. Irvin Khoza spoke glowingly of Zinnbauer after appointing him as a coach to replace the departed Serbian, who was recently sacked by Zamalek. “It is a fine balancing act that goes beyond the all-important technical skills,” he said. “A coach is tasked to win through others. His ability to keep the team focused, making them work in concert, with minimal lapses is an important requirement. I hope that Josef Zinnbauer is able to hit the deck running. I know I am fullya representative of all the Orlando Pirates supporters in wishing him good luck.” Zinnbauer expressed his gratitude at the opportunity to coach a club of Orlando Pirates’ calibre and stature. “I welcome the opportunity to lead one of the prestigious clubs on the African continent. I hope under my lead, we are able to return the club to its winning ways". Zinnbauer will be assisted by Rhulani Mokwena and Fadlu Davids. “It is important that we thank Rhulani for the fearless manner in which he stepped up to the plate when the need arose,” Khoza said. “One of the important lessons leaders learn at the top is about themselves. They are called, “Knowing what I know now” lessons. I have no doubt that Rhulani has learnt a lot of those for his betterment and that of the team”.
