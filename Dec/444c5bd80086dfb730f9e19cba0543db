As part of the turn-around strategy, SAFA is on the verge of concluding various sponsorships deals that will generate long term and sustainable funding. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Football Association (Safa) has announced a number of initiatives as part of the broader and sustainable turnaround strategy. At a briefing on Thursday, the association confirmed that they managed to bring down the annual expenditure by R80 million as part of austerity financial measures and cost-cutting exercise. As part of the turn-around strategy, Safa is on the verge of concluding various sponsorships deals that will generate long-term and sustainable funding. The Financial Recovery Plan follows the signing of a new contract with the SABC for free-to-air broadcast rights. This four-year contract is key to their negotiations for other sponsorship deals. Here's a look at some of their plans: The Association has announced that ahead of the Annual General Meeting on Sunday, 8 December, they will propose a game-changing subscription fee by all of its members, which if adopted, will raise a minimum of R300m annually. “We are going full throttle to turn around our financial situation and we are confident that if all goes well and we implement all of the initiatives, we should have long term and sustainable funding going forward,” said SAFA Acting CEO, Gay Mokoena. “All our national teams fulfilled their obligations and did exceptionally well and next year is going to be even busier with Bafana Bafana involved in the FIFA World Cup and AFCON 2021 Cameroon qualifiers. “Banyana Banyana will also be involved in the AWCON qualifiers while the u23 will be going to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and all our junior teams will be busy as well,” added Mokoena.
