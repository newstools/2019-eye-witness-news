The overcrowded church has become a temporary home to 479 people. Tshwane emergency services said about 1,300 people were affected by the recent floods. Makhura said an interim task team committee would organise new houses. "In all these areas, we want them out of these community facilities before Christmas. Because if they stay there longer, it creates new hazards. We have children here, elderly people. We don't want a situation where you create new problems." But the premier could not provide answers when asked how the task team would allocate the proposed houses.

But these people have been affected by a disaster. We must assist them." Residents will continue to stay in the community hall for the next few days.
