He wanted the matter heard urgently. but that part of his application failed on Thursday morning, with the Port Elizabeth High Court dismissing it with costs, saying it wasn't urgent enough. Bobani's lawyer Danie Gouws said: “All the judge said was this matter is not urgent enough to be heard; she already listened to the merits but it can be placed on a normal court roll and we can proceed from there on.”
