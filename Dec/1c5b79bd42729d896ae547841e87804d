CAPE TOWN - Imbokodo captain Zintle Mpupha said the reality of playing in Cape Town Sevens this weekend had started to kick in into their minds. Mpupha said it was a huge opportunity for them as a team to be part of the tournament but admits they want to add value. The Springboks World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi visited the girls this week for advice - something that Mpupha says it strengthen their minds. "As the reality now kicks into our minds as well we going to be playing against the best team in the world - as we know where we are and what is expected, so for us, it's such a huge opportunity to show up here," said Mpupha. "He [Siya Kolisi] said we don't have to listen to what people say because they'll always have something to say. As a team, we need to stay focus and united at all times - we need to focus on our work and goals. "Yes, it will be great to be part of it all, but we also want to add something to the tournament, we want to showcase what we can do and test ourselves against the best teams in the world.‚Äù
