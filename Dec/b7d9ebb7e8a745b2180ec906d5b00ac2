The suspect and his son Simion Mluyi were reported missing in Kuilsriver at the end of November. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said the father confessed to killing his son. She said he took officers to a spot near a canal in Soneike in Kuilsriver and pointed out where the child's body was buried. “Detectives, with support from other crime scene experts, retrieved the decomposed body near a canal in Soneike, Kuilsriver on Saturday afternoon. DNA tests to determine whether the body is indeed that of the 12-year-old missing boy will be conducted soon,” she said.
