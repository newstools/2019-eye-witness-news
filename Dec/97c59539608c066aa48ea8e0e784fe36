The defence force said that suspects had been taken in for questioning. JOHANNESBURG - The SA National Defence Force (SANDF) has confirmed that weapons have been stolen from its Lyttleton TEK base in Pretoria. The SANDF has not divulged details around the break-in but the Democratic Alliance (DA) claimed that criminals were able to walk off with 19 R4 automatic rifles which are manufactured for extreme warfare. The party said that the incident was outrageous and said the SANDF had let the nation down. The defence force said that an undisclosed number of suspects had been taken in for questioning. Spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini said that this did not point to lax security. "It doesn't point to a lack of security, it points to certain individuals who may know and have knowledge of how we store our weapons. You cannot walk into any SANDF base and walk straight to weapons are stored if you do not have knowledge and access to certain information which may be at someone's disposal."
