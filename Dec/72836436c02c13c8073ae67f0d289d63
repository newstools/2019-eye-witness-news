The party described the daily maverick as a "propaganda" publication, its leader Julius Malema says the online news agency has always been aware of its standing with the EFF. eNCA's editor in chief Jeremy Maggs said, “The station has taken what I believe to be a principled decision to stop covering the EFF elective conference. We were very concerned after the party barred several news organisations from covering the event. We believe, as a station, this is an attack on media freedom.” Meanwhile, theDaily Maverick claims it was banned from covering the EFF's national assembly because of its reporting on the VBS scandal. Journalists from the media house have been banned from obtaining accreditation to cover the three-day event.
