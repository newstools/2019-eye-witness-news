New Zealand have been crowned Cape Town Sevens champions after beating the Blitzboks 7-5 at Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. New Zealand exacted revenge for last week's Dubai Sevens final loss by narrowly beating the Blitzboks 7-5 on Sunday to be crowned Cape Town Sevens champions. New Zealand gained a final berth by beating Fiji earlier in the day, while South Africa cruised passed France in front of a packed Cape Town stadium. Both New Zealand and South Africa currently occupy the top two spots on the World Rugby Sevens Series standing. South Africa lead with 22 points to New Zealand's 19. It was a high-intensity final, with quality performances from both sides. The Blitzboks kept knocking on New Zealand's door in the first half, with no luck. The match went to half time with no points on the board. In the second half, both coaches looked for ways to dismantle their opponents' defence, and in the end it was New Zealand who gave in. South Africa broke the deadlock courtesy of Justin Geduld's try for a 5-0 lead. With four minutes left, play had to be stopped following a scuffle between both sets of players. After match officials consulted with the touchline official, both captains were issued with warnings. New Zealand took the lead with less than 3 minutes left on the clock, with their first try of the match. The â€ŽAll Blacks converted the try, which was the difference in the end between the sides. Earlier New Zealand women were also crowned Cape Town Sevens champions after a 17-7 victory over Australia women.
