JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal police have launched a manhunt after an officer was murdered outside his home in the suburb of Phoenix at the weekend. Police said the policeman was leaving his residence when he was approached by a group of men in a white Toyota Etios. The officer was then shot several times but managed to return fire and killed one of his attackers. “I have been assured that the 72-hour activation plan has been mobilised with the all the necessary resources deployed to track down the remaining suspects,” said acting National Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Fannie Masemola in a statement. “We, the police management, have made a clarion call to all our police officers never to fall with a gun in their hands. Our colleague fought a brave fight today but sadly he lost his life, but not without ensuring that his assailant went down too,” he added.
