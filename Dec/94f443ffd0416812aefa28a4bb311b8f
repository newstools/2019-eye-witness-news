Julius Malema is presenting his political report to the second national people’s assembly at Nasrec, near Soweto, under the theme 'consolidating the ground towards socialist power'. JOHANNESBURG – Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has recounted the party’s successes over the past four years, saying although it is still in its infancy it has superseded formations which predates it. He is presenting his political report to the second national people’s assembly at Nasrec, near Soweto, under the theme “consolidating the ground towards socialist power”. Malema says although the party has faced challenges along the way, its achievements far outweigh the difficulties. He has listed proposed legislation that the EFF sponsored in parliament and its campaign for the in-sourcing among others as some of their monumental feats. “The EFF motion on the amendment of the Constitution was adopted on 27 February 2019. The EFF motion of no confidence in the former president formed the basis of all deliberations and discussions that resulted in him resigning as president of the republic of South Africa – bringing to an end the rule by criminal syndicates.” The party has already set its sights on the 2024 national elections with its leader saying the party will now focus on multiplying the gains from this year’s polls. The party received just over one point eight million votes in the May elections. He has called on EFF members to consolidate its grassroots supporters and mobilise more members to ensure at least ten million votes by the next national elections.
