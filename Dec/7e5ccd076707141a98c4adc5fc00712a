With the four-match test series against England starting on Boxing Day, Faf du Plessis said the focus must shift away from the board room. JOHANNESBURG - Proteas captain Faf du Plessis has called for the focus to shift to the field matters after a turbulent week behind the scenes at Cricket South Africa. On Saturday, CSA president Chris Nenzani announced that Jacques Faul will occupy the position of interim CEO following the suspension of Thabang Moroe on Friday. Nenzani also said former captain Graeme Smith was expected to sign on as director of cricket before Wednesday this week. With the four-match test series against England starting on Boxing Day, du Plessis said the focus must shift away from the board room. “There’s not much time left between now and the England series. So now, it’s about putting our focus back on the test team and making sure that the team gets all the things that they need to be successful,” he said. He was speaking on Sunday after his Mzansi Super League side, Paarl Rocks, secured a home final after finishing on top of the standings. Du Plessis wouldn’t give his opinion on what has transpired over the last couple of weeks, only stating that the players must focus on the task ahead. “From my perspective, it’s about making sure that the players are focused on the cricket side of things. The players have nothing to do with what’s happening behind the scenes and for me, it’s important to separate that from a player’s point of view. If it needs me to be dealing with some of these things then that’s ok, but it’s about getting focused on what is important, which is the test series against England,” he said. The first of four test matches against England starts in Centurion on 26 December.
