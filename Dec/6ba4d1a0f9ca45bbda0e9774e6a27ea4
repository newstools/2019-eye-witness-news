Springbok Sevens coach Neil Powell said there was no real need to change the squad after they did so well in Dubai. JOHANNESBURG - Springbok Sevens coach Neil Powell named an unchanged squad for the HSBC Cape Town Sevens tournament, which kicks off on Friday at the Cape Town Stadium. Siviwe Soyizwapi will lead the same team that left Dubai last weekend as gold medal winners. Powell said there was no real need to change the squad after they did so well in Dubai. "We did bring in Hacjivah Dayimani as 13th player as we wanted to give him a feel for the World Series, but his ankle injury put paid to that idea. Impi Visser will be our official reserve this time around and I am quite comfortable having him around. He played very well for us last season and will be ready to slot in if needed," he said. Despite the success in Dubai, which has left South Africa top of the overall standings, Powell is under no illusions as to how difficult this weekendâ€™s tournament will be. "We certainly played better as the tournament progressed, but this weekend we start at zero again. Japan is a difficult opponent to start against and Fiji and USA were the top two teams in last year's series," he said. The Blitzboks kick off their campaign at 20:03pm against Japan on Friday evening, while Fiji and the USA await on Saturday. The Blitzbok squad for the HSBC Cape Town Sevens:1. Chris Dry 2. Ryan Oosthuizen 3. Dylan Sage 4. Zain Davids 5. JC Pretorius 6. Siviwe Soyizwapi 7. Selvyn Davids 8. Rosko Specman 9. Justin Geduld 10. Kurt-Lee Arendse 11. Seabelo Senatla 12. Ruhan Nel 13.
