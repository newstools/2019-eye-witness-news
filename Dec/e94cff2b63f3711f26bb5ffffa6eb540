Siphiwe Tshabalala applauded Chiefs' momentum this season, saying the team was on the roll. CAPE TOWN - Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala believes and hopes this season is a breakthrough for Amakhosi, who have been waiting to lift a silverware. On Thursday, Tshabalala applauded Chiefs' momentum this season, saying the team was on the roll. The 35-year-old is part of the Absa #StoptoStart initiative as a commitment to be an active part of the solution in the fight against gender-based violence. The initiative has featured former players including former Absa Premiership players such as Teko Modise, Brilliant Khuzwayo and Phumudzo Manenzhe who are providing support through interactive workshops and football-themed activations to more than 800 teenage boys, aged 15-17, from four schools in four provinces during the month of December. Tshabalala said he hoped this would be the breakthrough the club has been looking for after so many seasons without a trophy. "I hope this season its a breakthrough they've been looking for - I hope that the team will get something this season," said Tshabalala. "They are on a roll, now things are going well for them and I believe and wish that in the next round, they will excel. I hope they'll bring success and silverware this season." Last season, the 35-year-old Tshabalala made his Chiefs departure to Turkish Super Lig side BB Erzurumspor after 11 years at the club. In those 11 years at Naturena, Tshabalala made 372 appearances scoring 58 goals in a wonderful career at the club. The Glamour Boys are currently sitting on top of the log on 34 points after playing 13 matches with just one loss and 10 points clear.
