The DA approached the High Court after chaotic scenes in the council ahead of a vote to remove Mokgalapa and Mathebe.The ANC’s Kgosi Maepa said: “While the (court) review happens, the council will continue. Council will continue and we can remove the people again on 3 January.” The DA has been given seven days to file review application papers.
