CITY POWER WARNS OF FRAUDSTERS Meanwhile, Joburg residents were warned against fraudsters posing as City Power  employees allegedly trying to extort money from customers. The utility said two incidents were reported where these people - under the preteens of City Power technicians or contractors - had asked customers to pay a sum of money to avoid their power supply being cut. City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said the imposters could be working with the utility’s employees to target residents. “We can’t rule out the fact that our own employees or even contractors could be part of these people. We also can’t rule out that someone within City Power or the City of Johannesburg, who has a bill of some of our customers, could give that kind of information to fraudsters,” he said.
