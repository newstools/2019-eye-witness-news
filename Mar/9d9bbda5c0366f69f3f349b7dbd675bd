Stage two load shedding kicked in at 8 this morning and it's likely to last until about 11pm. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom says its generation system is extremely constrained meaning it needs to implement load shedding both today and tomorrow. Stage two load shedding kicked in at 8 this morning and it's likely to last until about 11pm. Eskom says the blackouts will allow its reserves to recover for the week ahead and will also give technicians time to carry out necessary maintenance and repairs on its generation fleet. The utility's Andrew Etzinger said, “Unfortunately the new stations are continually unreliable and inconsistent in terms of the output.”
