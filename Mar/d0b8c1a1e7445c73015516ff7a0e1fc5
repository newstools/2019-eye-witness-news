If the DA does not succeed, South Africa will not succeed. Amandla!” Maimane says his party is ready to govern the biggest province in the country and it will. “They must sort out their nonsense, and once they do they must be outside of government.” Maimane says the change will only come to this country when the DA takes over the government after 8 May. It's time for a DA-led Gauteng. A government that will work to build #OneSAforAll!#DAManifestoGP | #MsimangaForPremier pic.twitter.com/D7CA6UeJXm
