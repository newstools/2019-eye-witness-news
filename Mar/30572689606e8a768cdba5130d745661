This week's sporadic acts of assault meted on immigrants have raised fears of a resurgence of xenophobic attacks. JOHANNESBURG - International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has called on law enforcement officers to act swiftly and deal with criminals following the recent spate of violence against foreign nationals. This week's sporadic acts of assault meted on immigrants have raised fears of a resurgence of xenophobic attacks. Incidents have been reported in the provinces of Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal recently. In 2015 there was an upsurge in xenophobic attacks throughout the country, starting in Durban and spreading to Johannesburg after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini said foreigners should go back to their countries. At least seven people were killed during the violence. Sisulu has called for an urgent meeting with African ambassadors to devise ways of supporting communities and encouraging integration. She's urged all South Africans to take a stand against violence. The Department's Ndivhuwo Mabaya said that the violence is embarrassing.
