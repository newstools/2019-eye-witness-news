Edward Kieswetter's appointment to the Revenue Service is effective from 1 May this year. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Edward Kieswetter as the new commissioner of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) Ramaphosa made the appointment on the recommendation of the selection panel appointed by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Former commissioner Tom Moyane was fired after the Nugent Commission of Inquiry found he was neither fit nor proper to hold the position. Kieswetter will assume the role as Sars commissioner from 1 May on a five-year contract. The Presidency said Kieswetter emerged as the strongest candidate among the recommendations, given his past experience as deputy Sars commissioner between 2004 and 2009. Ramaphosa’s office said he has a record of transformative leadership and experience in turning around large institutions. It was during Kieswetter’s tenure that he established the large business centre and the high net worth individual unit. He later went on to become group chief executive of the Alexander Forbes Group. Ramaphosa said Kieswetter “has the experience, integrity and skills” required to turn Sars around. Mboweni said he expects the new commissioner to act without fear or favour, to restore and defend the integrity of Sars and to uphold taxpayer rights when carrying out his duties. Kieswetter was chosen from a list of six candidates, which included acting commission Mark Kingon and former executive Gene Ravele. Meanwhile, tobacco company Take Back The Tax has welcomed Kieswetter's appointment. In a statement released on Wednesday, it said: "Kieswetter is experienced and will hopefully start doing what’s right for Sars and for South Africa - which continues to lose R8 billion annually as a result of the illegal cigarette trade.‬ We call on him to act decisively against the illegal cigarette trade and to pay urgent attention to how that revenue [continues] being lost yearly."
