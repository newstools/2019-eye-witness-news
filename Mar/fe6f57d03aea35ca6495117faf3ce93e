Workers affiliated to trade union Nehawu and Public Servants Association (PSA) are demanding an 11.4% salary increase while Sars is offering 7%. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (Sars) says taxpayers will be penalised for late payments. This is despite an ongoing strike that left many branches closed from Thursday. Workers affiliated to trade union Nehawu and Public Servants Association (PSA) are demanding an 11.4% salary increase while Sars is offering 7%. The Revenue Service said it had a standing arrangement with the banks to ensure the ease of payments. Sars spokesperson Takalani Musekwa said: “Penalties will apply for late payments and obviously we’ll look at the reasons of the taxpayers. If they prove that they had a valid reason, then that will be considered. However, we don’t see why would be any problem with any payment.” Sars also said there had been no major disruptions at South Africa's ports of entry as a result of the strike. Unions had claimed that all ports of entry would be closed as customs officials would be joining the work stoppage. The Revenue Service said it had a contingency plan that’s ensured all border posts remain operational. Sars remuneration executive Takalani Musekwa said: “Because of managers we deployed at the ports of entry, we have experienced minimal disruptions in our services there and there was a continuous flow of trade. Where there were apparent traffic jams, that was normal jam.”
