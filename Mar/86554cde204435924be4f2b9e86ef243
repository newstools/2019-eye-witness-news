President Cyril Ramaphosa says the focus must also be on developing young people with skills to give them the opportunity to enter the job market. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says that government can no longer rely on factories and mines to create large-scale jobs, adding that small and medium enterprises is the new way.

We as the government want to give create these incubation centres, where we draw in young people."
