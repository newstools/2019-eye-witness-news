Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga said Gauteng has an influx of more than 300,000 migrants a year. PRETORIA - Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga says calling for tougher immigration reforms does not mean the province wants to close its doors to immigrants. Msimanga was the keynote speaker at the provincial launch of the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Gauteng manifesto. The party wants immigration laws to be enforced by Home Affairs so that criminals are deported, and all migrants are documented. Msimanga said Gauteng has an influx of more than 300,000 migrants a year.  He added undocumented immigrants end up putting a strain on Gauteng hospitals and schools. “We don’t even know how many people are coming into Gauteng. Where the Democratic Alliance governs we recognise the importance in migration.” Msimanga said that the party [Democratic Alliance] would lobby for the deployment of the Defence Force to guard the borders. “We’ll ensure that the police arrest, detain and deploy those who enter our country illegally.” Msimanga said controlled migration would help both South Africans and immigrants.  PREGNANT WITH OPPORTUNITIES Msimanga has said the province is one that is pregnant with opportunities but needs the right government to turn them into reality. He added this includes having one person who is employed in every household in Gauteng. Msimanga says this province cannot be allowed to fail because this means SA will fail. “In Gauteng, we promote the culture of learning, service delivery and safety.” He said the party will also focus on hospitals, fixing the education industry, and improving policing. “In Gauteng, we’ll make sure that we cut the queues through better management and technology.” The DA says it’s the only party that can truly transform Gauteng into a prosperous and progressive province.
