He deserves a medal. He didn't look the other way, he saved a soul. 🎖️🏅🥉🥇  I’m hundred percent sure that the hero doesn’t own a smartphone.Nobody helps these days they take videos.  Parts of Gauteng, including Johannesburg, have experienced severe thunderstorms and heavy downpours. In December 2016, Everlate Chauke's body was found after she was swept away during flash floods in the Alexandra informal settlement, which is a few metres away from the river. While residents were warned of the dangers of living on the banks of the river, many have nowhere to go.
