Venter has told the Zondo commission of inquiry that Agrizzi coerced him into compiling an affidavit in December 2017 which details Watson’s alleged crimes including tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. JOHANNESBURG - Former Bosasa auditor Peet Venter claims Angelo Agrizzi offered to pay him if he co-operated in exposing CEO Gavin Watson's alleged illegal activities at the controversial company. Venter has told the Zondo Commission of Inquiry that Agrizzi coerced him into compiling an affidavit in December 2017 which details Watson’s alleged crimes including tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. Venter said during a meeting at Agrizzi's home in Fourways he drafted the statement but didn't want to sign it, fearing he might lose his job. “I expressed my concerns to Mr Agrizzi. He asked me how much I wanted in going against Mr Watson. Mr Agrizzi showed me on his cellphone of the what the value of all his investments are and the amount was about R335,000 a month. He said that he would pay.”  BOSASA-RAMAPHOSA PAYMENT Venter also claimed he was surprised when Watson instructed him to make a payment of R500,000 to President Cyril Ramaphosa's son. Venter said they used a dormant company and not Bosasa's bank accounts to facilitate the payment to Andile Ramaphosa's foundation. “When I asked Watson who the payment was for, he said is was for the foundation of Andile Ramaphosa. It was a payment coming in and going out because there was no purpose or service rendered for that money.” After initially telling Parliament that the R500,000 donation paid to his son by Bosasa was above board, the president then had to backtrack. Ramaphosa wrote to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete clarifying that the money went towards a trust fund set up for his presidential campaign and he had no knowledge of this.
