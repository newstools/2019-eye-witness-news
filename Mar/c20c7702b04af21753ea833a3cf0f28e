Eyewitness News (EWN) has put together some information on where and how you could check how long your area could be load shed: JOHANNESBURG – Power utility Eskom announced it will be implementing stage 4 load shedding and that means your area can be hit by blackouts at any time without any warning. Stage four load shedding also means the power utility starts additional, unscheduled power cuts wherever it needs to and outside of its schedules.  However, Eskom said despite the rolling power cuts, it’s managed to meet 80 percent of the country's demands. The utility has also urged consumers to use electricity sparingly as that could lead to reduced levels of load shedding.
