The Emmy Award-winning soapie centres around the fashion designing Forrester family and has been airing for over two decades in South Africa. JOHANNESBURG - After years of entertaining viewers on SABC 3, popular US soapie The Bold and the Beautiful will no longer air as of Monday 4 March. The Emmy Award-winning soapie centres around the fashion designing Forrester family and has been airing for over two decades in South Africa. It was first aired on SABC 1 in September 1997 until it moved to SABC 3 a few years ago. The SABC says the decision to remove the soapie was taken as a result of the showâ€™s poor return on investment while the financial investment to acquire it kept increasing. "In response to the current financial challenges facing the SABC, the channel is implementing a programming strategy which seeks to ensure that it provides compelling and entertaining programming, that resonates with audiences. "From 4 March, SABC 3 will broadcast a news and current affairs programme, Democracy Gauge at 5:30pm. This will be followed by the local sitcom, Taryn and Sharon at 6pm and local drama Keeping Score at 6:30pm." The SABC thanked all the viewers who have shown unwavering support to the show since its debut. [WATCH] Soweto shows 'Brooke Logan' tons of SA love
