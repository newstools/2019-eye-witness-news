JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has praised the police for the swift arrests of two more suspects linked to the fatal stabbing of a Mondeor High School pupil. Kulani Mathebula (19) was killed on Wednesday while walking to his school. Hours after the stabbing, police arrested a 13-year-old boy and in the early hours of Thursday morning, they arrested two more 15-year-old boys. â€¢ What kind of punishment do minors face for violent crimes? Lesufi says that he is impressed with the turnaround in the investigation. "Praises and praises to police. I never thought that I would see the day that I would have to hand over a body to a parent. When they hear the news that they've arrested somebody, it brings that little relief."
