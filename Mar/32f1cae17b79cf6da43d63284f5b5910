President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to start at Mabopane station and the party’s national chair Gwede Mantashe will be at Daanboom station in Mamelodi. TSHWANE - African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa and national chairperson Gwede Mantashe are interacting with commuters on Monday morning as they hop on trains in Tshwane as part of the party's election campaign. The rest of the ANC’s top six cancelled at the eleventh hour. Ramaphosa has arrived in the area while the corridor leading to the train platform is lined with people wearing yellow ANC T-shirts bearing Ramaphosa’s picture. The president is expected to start his morning at Mabopane station while Mantashe will be at Daanboom station in Mamelodi. From there, they are expected to interact with residents at Bosman station before ending off their Tshwane tour. The aim of the blitz campaign is to encourage Tshwane residents to vote the ANC back into power. In 2016, the Democratic Alliance (DA) won the majority votes and took over the city. The ANC hopes to govern the capital city again.     Tshwane has been under Democratic Alliance-led administration for more than two years after a change in power in 2016. The Economic Freedom Fighters is also aiming to gain control over the capital the first time. The African National Congress' election head Fikile Mbalula said: “Every part of the country is very important, Tshwane included. We were in Mafikeng yesterday, we are here [now] and we are all over. We are just here in the last days [ahead of the elections] to remind the people about the important occasion.”
