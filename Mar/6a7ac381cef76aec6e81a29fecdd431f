The 19-year-old Mondeor High School pupil, Kulani Mathebula, was stabbed to death by allegedly three teenagers from another school. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he is deeply saddened by the loss of a Mondeor High School pupil because instead of issuing a report card to his family, he is now having to issue them with a death certificate. Lesufi was speaking on Friday at the memorial service of Kulani Mathebula held at the school in Soweto. The 19-year-old was stabbed to death by allegedly three teenagers from another school; they have since been arrested. Lesufi has urged the family to remain strong. “Instead of bidding the learner farewell for a university, I am bidding the learner farewell because he’s going to a grave.” Lesufi appealed to Mathebula's friends not to try and avenge his murder. “Friends, please... I said it when I met with you [learners] and I want to emphasise it; no revenge. An eye for an eye makes all of us blind.” WATCH: Kulani Mathebula memorial: ‘Every dream he had for himself was taken away’  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
