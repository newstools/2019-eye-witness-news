JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has confirmed that the State has withdrawn charges against two of three adults arrested in connection with the murder of Thoriso Themane due to insufficient evidence. The duo, aged between 36 and 37, appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court earlier on Monday. The same court also granted bail of R1,000 each to two adults arrested in connection with the murder of the 28-year-old. The 28-year-old's death last month sparked outrage after a video showing a group of high school pupils assaulting him in Flora Park in Polokwane went viral. At the same time, the case against a 13-year-old also arrested for Themane's murder has been postponed until next week. The teenager was apprehended over the weekend and appeared in court in camera on Monday.
