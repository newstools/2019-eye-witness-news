According to the Child Justice Act, people under the age of 18 are considered minors. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) also states that the Child Justice Section refers to young offenders as children from 0 to 18 years. Eyewitness News spoke to Justice Magayi, supervisory legal practitioner from Legal Aid SA, for clarity on how these violent crimes by minors have been handled, and whether the calls for harsher punishments will be considered. HOW ARE MINORS CHARGED AND TRIED? Magayi said minors are not arrested as is the case with adults but instead the Child Justice Act is applied. If it‚Äôs a minor offence, the police won‚Äôt arrest them, but would take them to their parents and ask them to appear in court on a particular day. In the case of Themane, which is murder, a schedule three offence, the minors have been arrested and kept in holding cells away from adult offenders and will have to bring a formal bail application.  The legal practitioner said the minors will have to appear in court. ‚ÄúCourt proceedings are held in camera, a legal term that means 'in private'. The public and the media are not allowed in court to protect the child from abuse or harm and protect the identity of the child. Whereas adults would be in open court, meaning open to the public.‚Äù The offenders have since appeared in court and proceedings have been postponed to next week. HOW ARE MINORS SENTENCED? The Child Justice Act states that one of its aims is to increase the sentencing options available to the courts with regards to children. Magayi said the minimum murder sentence for adults is 15 years and the maximum is 25 years. This does not apply for minors because the aim is to reintegrate them back into society. He added that in this case the State will rely on doctrine of common purpose because they all acted together. Before a child is sentenced, the Constitution comes into play, Section 28 states we should avoid sentencing and sending young offenders to imprisonment or jail. However, if that can‚Äôt be avoided, it must as a last resort and for the shortest period of time.  Magayi noted that the court also considers the following factors when sentencing minors: ‚Ä¢    The seriousness of the matter ‚Ä¢    The amount of harm done ‚Ä¢    Whether the children take accountability for their conduct ‚Ä¢    The severity of the impact of the offence on the victim and his family and the community ‚Ä¢    Do we desire to keep the children out of prison? Magayi said various factors would also be considered, such as how they grew up, the interest of the public and if there was evidence. He added that if found guilty, the teenagers might be sent to jail, but not for a long time. According to the NPA, minors are offered an opportunity to change their lives instead of going deeper in the criminal justice system and becoming hardened criminals. WHAT KIND OF PUNISHMENT DO THEY FACE? Magayi says minors face serving time in correctional facilities are termed juveniles. ‚ÄúThe famous one is Leeuwkop in Johannesburg which houses both adults and minors, but in separate areas of the facility.‚Äù He added that when minors become adults (turn 18), they are then moved to a facility with adults to finish serving their sentence. ‚ÄúWhen they become too big for juvenile correctional facility, they would be put with adults because they have to separate them from the children as it‚Äôs not allowed.‚Äù Officials have confirmed that nine teenagers have been arrested in total for the murder of Themane. Three of them, including a teenage girl, were taken in overnight. Five school boys appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates on Thursday, while another suspect was arrested on Wednesday. #ThorisoThemane [ BREAKING] Polokwane police have confirmed 3 more teenagers have been arrested in connection with the murder of 28 year old Thoriso Themane.
