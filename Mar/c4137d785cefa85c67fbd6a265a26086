Police Minister Bheki Cele says police are on the lookout for two other accomplices who have been identified. JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele says that one suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder of South African actor Sibusiso Khwinana. Cele says that police are on the lookout for two other accomplices who have been identified. He was speaking at Khwinana’s funeral in Soshanguve. The police minister assured mourners that police are working to secure justice for Khwinana’s killing. The star of the South African hit film Matwetwe was murdered during a robbery last week. His death sent shock waves across the country’s entertainment industry, with fellow actors describing him as a rising star. Cele says the suspect will appear in court on Monday. Cele says the ministry will be in consultation with the country’s artists to devise ways to ensure their safety. “What they [artists] think we [the police] can do to make their lives better in terms of safety. But for now, we want to say to the young man [Sibusiso] rest.”
