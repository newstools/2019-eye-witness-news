The Presidency says President Ramaphosa established the investigating directorate on the recommendations of prosecutions boss Shamiela Batohi and the ministers of police as well as justice and correctional services. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa has issued a proclamation which establishes an investigative directorate within the office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). The president told Parliament in February that he planned to establish the unit in order to deal with the high number of cases emanating from state capture investigations. South Africa last had such capacity in the Scorpions, which was shut down back in 2007 following an African National Congress (ANC) resolution. Ramaphosa’s office says he’s established the investigating directorate on the recommendations of prosecutions boss Shamiela Batohi and the ministers of police as well as justice and correctional services. The Presidency says the directorate will investigate crimes such as fraud and theft, as well as the contravention of legislation such as the prevention and combating of corrupt activities act. In addition, it will handle high profile or complex corruption offences stemming from the numerous commissions of inquiry. These include the Nugent commission, which investigated the South African Revenue Service; the Zondo commission looking into state capture; as well as the Mpati commission, which is focused on impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation.
