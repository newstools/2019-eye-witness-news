Cape Town will be staging the event and the centre will be used as one of the main venues. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry says the 2023 Netball World Cup could inject new life into the Good Hope Centre. Cape Town will be staging the event and the centre will be used as one of the main venues. The under-used building has a new lease on life, according to the chamber's president Geoff Jacobs. “The centre is in a unique position geographically. It’s a stone's throw from the Cape Town CBD. It’s just opposite the Cape Town station. As strategic as its position is, it’s been much neglected in recent years.”
