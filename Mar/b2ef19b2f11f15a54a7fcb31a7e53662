JOHANNESBURG - A City Power electricity pylon and its overhead lines have caved in, setting fire to multiple shacks in Stjwetla, in Alexandra. City Power said the number of casualties is not yet known, however, paramedics are on the scene. It’s understood the blaze is spreading to nearby homes. Spokesperson Isaac Mangena said: “As of now, we don’t know the cause of this and we are also not sure if there are any causalities. We have dispatched a team from City Power to the area to investigate. The line carries about 88 kilovolts of electricity and can severely injure [one] when in contact with a person.” FIRE EXTINGUISHED Firefighters in Alexandra have managed to extinguish the massive fire. The unconfirmed number of shacks that have burnt down has left residents homeless. Those who are affected were scrambling to save as many belongings as possible. Emergency services and firefights were still at the scene monitoring the situation to make sure the blaze doesn’t flare up again. City Power has identified a number of areas that are affected by the power loss as a result of the fire which include Greenstone Park, Thornhill Estate, Greenstone Shopping Centre, Longmeadow Ext 2, 7, 10, 17 and 19. FIREFIGHTERS ACCUSED OF INACTION As residents continue to pick up the pieces after following the devastating fire, some of them say they are disappointed by the response time of authorities. “These firefighters took almost one and a half hours after the fire started [to get here].” One community member, who doesn’t want to be named, said they don’t know where people will sleep tonight. “We are just going to take their list and try to see how we are going to help because they have nowhere else to sleep.”
