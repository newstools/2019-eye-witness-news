Officials have identified incomplete investigations and delays in obtaining forensic reports as some of the factors affecting such cases. CAPE TOWN - Provincial and national community safety authorities are collaborating on a plan to ensure that violent crimes make it through the courts without excessive delays. The Western Cape Community Safety Department has started a programme called Watching Briefs which observes the progress of gang-related cases. Officials have identified incomplete investigations and delays in obtaining forensic reports as some of the factors affecting such cases. A recent report reveals that between October and December more than 300 cases were struck off the court roll. MEC Alan Winde commended the national Police Minister, Bheki Cele, for buying into the plan. “The good news is that Cele has accepted our Watching Briefs programme. The programme will monitor certain court cases, once police have made an arrest, and ensure that they are effectively dealt with.” MURDERS The Kraaifontein community has been rocked by two murders this week.
