JOHANNESBURG - The rand slipped on Tuesday, surrendering the previous session’s gains as the dollar rebounded from a sell-off triggered by fears the United States economy is heading for recession. Stocks closed up slightly as riskier assets showed signs of stability, while the bullion sector weighed on further gains. The rand was 0.66% weaker at 14.4050 per dollar at 1613 GMT, compared to a close of 14.3100 overnight in New York. “Market fears over the US economy heading for a recession seem to be easing and this continues to support appetite for the greenback,” FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said. “The South African rand like many other emerging market currencies is likely to remain driven by external factors this week.” On Monday, the rand gained more than 1% in a broad emerging market rally sparked by renewed fears that economic growth in developed markets was set to contract after an inversion of the US yield curve and poor manufacturing data from Germany and Japan.
