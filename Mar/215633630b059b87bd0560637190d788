The party staged a demonstration at Parliament on Tuesday against the Economic Freedom Fighters draft motion calling for the airport’s name to be changed. The party's chief whip Corne Mulder has suggested a different name. "If that is not acceptable and we have to look at names, then we say a name like Krotoa makes a lot more sense. Krotoa represents the ideas and symbols of the traditional people of the Western Cape." (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
