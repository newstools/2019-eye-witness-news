The first leg against Angola will take place in Luanda on 22 March, with the return leg scheduled for Milpark Stadium on 26 March 2019. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa Under-23 coach David Notoane has released a provisional 27-man squad to prepare for the upcoming CAF first round Tokyo 2020 Olympic qualifier against Angola. South Africa was one of the few countries on the continent that was given a bye in the preliminary round and will battle it out with Angola to determine who plays either Zimbabwe or eSwatini/Mozambique in the second round. The winner of the second round will qualify for the CAF 8-Nations tournament scheduled for Egypt in November this year in which the three top teams from that tournament automatically earn a berth at the Olympics in 2020. The first leg against Angola will take place in Luanda on 22 March, with the return leg scheduled for Milpark Stadium on 26 March 2019. Coach Notoane, who will trim the squad to 23 on Monday, said he had delayed naming the final team as he still wanted to watch weekend matches. He also didnâ€™t rule out bringing in one or two new faces into the current squad.
