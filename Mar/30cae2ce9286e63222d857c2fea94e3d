The president's son has told News24 that, in hindsight, due diligence was not sufficiently carried out by his company Blue Crane Capital in retrospect of his fatherâ€™s role going into the presidency. JOHANNESBURG - In an about turn, President Cyril Ramaphosa's son has now reportedly admitted that Bosasa did, in fact, pay him R2 million for a business deal, which he says he now regrets. Andile Ramaphosa has told News24 that in hindsight due diligence was not sufficiently carried out by his company, Blue Crane Capital, in retrospect of his father's role going into the presidency. The company was contracted to carry out advisory work for some government departments. It also did business with private companies in parts of the continent. Andile Ramaphosa's controversial dealings with Bosasa, now known as African Global Operations, have been a thorn on the side of the African National Congress (ANC), and in particular his father. The president has always maintained that there was never a corrupt relationship between him, his son and Bosasa after the controversial company donated half a million rand towards his presidential campaign. Just this month, he refused to reveal in Parliament what his son earned for services rendered to the company. But now Andile Ramaphosa has admitted that his company signed an advisory mandate with Bosasa, earning the business a monthly fee of R150,000. This later increased to R230,000. This latest revelation will likely lead to further backlash against the president, who opposition parties have accused of a cover-up. (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
