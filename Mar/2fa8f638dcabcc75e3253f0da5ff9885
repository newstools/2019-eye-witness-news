It is not yet clear why she has decided to leave Outa or what her next move will be. JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress (ANC) MP Makhosi Khoza has resigned from the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa). She split paths with the ANC in 2017 and formed her own political party - the African Democratic Change (ADC). When the party failed, Khoza said that she was retiring from politics. She cites in a resignation letter seen by Eyewitness News that she would like to explore other avenues to contribute in bringing about real change in the country. Khoza says she can't fight the battles - which she lists as state capture and other corruption in government - on Outa's civil society platform.
