The company said “a small number of devices” have been implanted with the malicious code through a sophisticated attack on its Live Update servers. BENGALURU - Asus said on Tuesday it released an update to fix an attack, which according to security researchers had targeted one million-plus Asus users last year by hijacking the computer maker’s software update system. The company said “a small number of devices” have been implanted with the malicious code through a sophisticated attack on its Live Update servers. Moscow-based cybersecurity provider Kaspersky Lab said on Monday the attack took place between June and November last year and was used to deliver a software update with a “backdoor” that would give hackers access to infected machines.
