Mmusi Maimane says the days of the African National Congress being a dominant party will come to an end because the governing party's support is decreasing. JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane says a coalition government led by the DA is set to be the future of the country. The DA launched its 2019 Gauteng elections manifesto in Pretoria on Saturday. Maimane addressed supporters and said the African National Congress would no longer be the dominant party as its support base was decreasing.  Maimane said the latest polls show the ANC’s support dropped below the 50% mark and added that it is time to kick them out of government. “They are asking us to pay for the sins of the ANC and I am here to tell you enough is enough!”  Maimane said a coalition government would hold its leaders to account, unlike the ANC. “We want to pave the future, the future of South Africa.” Maimane further said the DA had proven its governance record in Johannesburg, Tshwane and the Western Cape.
