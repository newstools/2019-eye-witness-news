In a statement, Mazibuko she says that after deep personal reflections she apologises for the tone and the improper language she used towards her head of department and chief financial officer in the meeting. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Sports and Recreation MEC Faith Mazibuko has issued an apology after a recording emerged of her threatening her staff with dismissal if they failed to flout regulations and build sport facilities that she wanted to use to help the African National Congress (ANC) win elections. In a statement, Mazibuko she says that after deep personal reflections she apologises for the tone and the improper language she used towards her head of department and chief financial officer in the meeting. She adds that she is willing to subject herself to whatever sanction that Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the ANC find appropriate. LISTEN: Faith Mazibuko: Give me combi courts or your resignations  The ANC’s provincial secretary Jacob Khawe said he is embarrassed by Mazibuko's behaviour. “She uttered irresponsible words. The ANC in Gauteng wakes up and we are so embarrassed by such utterances, in particular utterances on racism where you label people as white and Indian.” Khawe said Mazibuko tried to explain herself by saying the specific unit in her department did not make their target. He said Mazibuko must give a more elaborate explanation.
