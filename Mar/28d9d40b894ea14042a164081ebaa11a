President Cyril Ramaphosa says party members have humbled themselves and placed their fate in the hands of voters. CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa has admitted that some within the African National Congress (ANC) have a cloud of guilt hanging over their heads as appears to be the case from testimonies delivered at the state capture inquiry. However, the president said the truth needed to be unearthed. Ramaphosa made the remarks while on his electioneering drive in Delft outside Cape Town on Friday. He said the party humbled themselves and placed their fate in the hands of voters. Ramaphosa said the ANC was putting measures in place to prevent state capture. “We have done a number of things wrong and we’re putting ourselves in the hands of our people with great humility. We need to repair whatever has gone wrong.” The president also acknowledged that revelations at the inquiry will hurt the ANC at polls in May.   'LET'S NO PANIC' President Ramaphosa has once again made an appeal to South Africans not to panic over the energy crisis at Eskom. Ramaphosa says allegations of sabotage that forced the power utility to implement load shedding are being investigated. He said government was addressing the crisis at Eskom. He urged South Africans to stand united and support government to help stabilise the power utility. “Let’s not panic, let’s join hands and work together. This is a problem for all of us, we want to restore energy so that our economy can continue functioning.” Eskom announced on Friday it successfully completed maintenance on a series of boiler tubes and the partial restoration of power supply from the Cahora Bassa Dam in Mozambique. The restored powerline means Eskom is back to stage two load shedding. Ramaphosa gave no timeframe as to how long load shedding would continue.
