The mayor has been arrested on a charge of murder. Mahlaba is set to appear at the Newcastle Magistrates Court next week. ANC provincial spokesperson Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said the law should be allowed to take its course. “We want to remind everyone while there’s progress with murder cases in the province, you have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Mahlaba is the third mayor to be arrested in the province on murder charges.
