The visitors were the quickest out the blocks as early as the fourth minute of the game when Andile Mbenyane headed home from a corner. JOHANNESBURG - Chippa United booked their place in the semifinals of the Nedbank Cup with a 5-3 penalty shootout win over Bidvest Wits after it finished 4-all in regular time. The match was devoid of all defences from both sides as they leaked goals at will. The visitors were the quickest out the blocks as early as the fourth minute of the game when Andile Mbenyane headed home from a corner. Wits then settled into the game and equalized 20 minutes later through Gift Motupa before Zimbabwean Terrence Dzvukamanja put the Clever Boys in front on the stroke of half time as he rose him and headed home from a set piece too. Just like the first half, the Chilli Boys scored first at the beginning of the second half through a Boikanyo Komane neatly taken penalty after the ball had struck Buhle Mkhwanzi’s hand in the box to level matters. Wits wrestled the advantage back when Dzvukamanja completed his brace and should have closed out the game but second-half substitute Ruzaigh Gamaldien’s cracking free kick in injury time ensured both teams would need an extra 30 minutes of play to decide who will join TS Galaxy and Golden Arrows in the last four. Rhulani Manzini struck a crucial blow at the beginning of the first half of extra time when he put Chippa in front but Deon Hotto levelled things up again in the second stanza to force the dreaded penalty shootout. The Chilli Boys were flawless from the penalty spot, netting all five of their attempts with Elias Pelembe the unfortunate player to miss a penalty for Wits. The last spot in the semifinals will be decided on Sunday when Kaizer Chiefs welcome Cape Town City at a sold-out Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
