Eskom and government say there’s no quick fix to the country's electricity issues, with months of load shedding still expected. CAPE TOWN - There's no end in sight for rolling blackouts and the economy, as well as ordinary South Africans, are taking strain. Eskom and government say there’s no quick fix, with months of load shedding still expected. The Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry has warned that small businesses face ruin. The chamber’s Geoffrey Jacobs said: “Pretty soon we’ll see businesses saying this no longer works for them. When the Minister of Public Enterprises says this is going to be around for a year or two, I don’t know how many businesses are going to be around in another year or two.” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said it would take one or two years for Eskom’s generation capacity to be stabilised.
