The matter was postponed on Wednesday after the accused asked for a new legal representative. JOHANNESBURG - The case of a well-known businessman accused of raping his three-year-old grandchild will be heard in the Pretoria Magistrates Court in June. The matter was postponed on Wednesday after the accused asked for a new legal representative. The childâ€™s mother contacted AfriForum last year, asking for legal assistance. A ruling has been set by the court that the identity of the businessman or information pertaining to the crime may not be made public. Prosecutor at AfriForum Wico Swanepoel said: "We cannot allow an individual like this person to get away with committing a crime against children because he has money and status. The private prosecution unit was established for equality before the law." (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
