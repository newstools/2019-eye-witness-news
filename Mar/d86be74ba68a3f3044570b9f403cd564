We want to continue with the promises made before 2009.” CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) national chairperson says that the party is not going to make new promises to people in the Western Cape.

Those were the words from Mantashe. “We’re not making new promises. We want to continue with the promises made before 2009.” Mantashe says the ANC’s programmes in the province were halted when it lost power in 2009. “Here [Western Cape], there’s a project called ‘Hostel to Home’, which was stopped in 2009.” Walking in the streets of Gugulethu #ThumaMina #VoteANC pic.twitter.com/WxqsJTeOlv  The ANC has been sitting in the opposition benches in the Western Cape for the last ten years. The party has struggled with internal battles since then. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
