JOHANNESBURG - Eskom  has denied reports that it has started planning for stage 5 and 6 load shedding, as it struggles to keep the country's lights on. Fin24  reported on Tuesday that officials had started preparations for stage 5 and 6 which would imply shedding 5,000 and 6,000 megawatts, respectively.  However, Eskom’s Andrew Etzinger said they hoped to take load shedding to a lower stage over the next few days. “Eskom is implementing stage 4 load shedding with no requirement to take that beyond stage 4, but media reports are to the contrary. There’s no requirement at this stage to escalate to stage 5 and 6.”
