JOHANNESBURG - Police say close to 50 taxi drivers who were arrested on Wednesday will appear in court on Friday for blockading roads during a taxi strike in Vereeniging. The group were arrested after they refused to disperse from the roads they had blocked. Police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades following a standoff with the taxi operators. The strike was triggered by ailing road infrastructure and delays in the upgrading of a taxi rank but the protest has since been suspended. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo: "Those that were arrested will be appearing in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court facing charges of public violence."
