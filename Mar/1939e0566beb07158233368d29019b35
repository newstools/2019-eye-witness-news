On Saturday morning, provincial chairperson Michael Moriaty told supporters they've proven their track record as the local government of Johannesburg. The party launched its provincial election manifesto at the Sausville Arena in Pretoria. The arena was filled by enthusiastic supporters. The DA told its members that the ANC’s time is up in the province. “It’s not only in Gauteng. They said we couldn’t win in Johannesburg, but we did. They say we won’t win in Gauteng, but we will,” Moriaty told supporters.
