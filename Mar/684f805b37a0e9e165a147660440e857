JOHANNESBURG – It’s emerged the man who was attacked outside Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp has been accused of committing murder in Munsieville. It’s understood he had been involved in an altercation early on Sunday morning and allegedly stabbed a 32-year-old man. He sustained an injury during the fight and was taken to hospital.
