David Mabuza is in the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon for his final question and answer session before it rises ahead of the 8 May elections. CAPE TOWN - Deputy President David Mabuza has told Parliament a well-planned land reform programme will not threaten the agricultural sector or the economy as a whole. Mabuza is in the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon for his final question and answer session before it rises ahead of the 8 May elections. "Instead, broadening access to land and participation by new entrants in the sector will unleash additional productive capacity to enhance agricultural output and create jobs." He’s also told Members of Parliament that the government’s audit and verification process of land that will be redistributed will be concluded by the end of April. "As government, we are in a process of finalising the land audit, the verification of these land parcels that are in the hands of government. That process will be concluded by the end of April. So, we will know how many land parcels are in the hands of government." Mabuza says this information will be made public. WATCH LIVE: David Mabuza answers questions in Parly
