He said it was apartheid and the DA wanted to see a South Africa for all the people. He accused the Freedom Front Plus of being divisive for campaigning just for white votes. The FF Plus took votes off the DA in by-elections in recent months. The most recent by-election was in a Krugersdorp ward this week where the FF Plus got almost 30% of the vote, up from six percent in 2016 in the ward, whereas the DA fell from 89% to 70%.
