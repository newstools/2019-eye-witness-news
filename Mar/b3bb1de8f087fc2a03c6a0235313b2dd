That's according to political analyst Daniel Silke who believes senior leaders will leave their provincial positions for national ones. CAPE TOWN - The release of provincial lists for the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape reveals several high ranking provincial members will likely be moving to national government after the May 8th elections. At a recent even in Cape Town, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was confident the party he leads will take back the Western Cape in the coming elections, in spite of the fact that the ANC has failed to gain any ground in the province over the last two election cycles. The ANC’s lists reveal acting ANC provincial leader Khaya Magaxa and provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs are both high on the list of provincial ANC members headed for the National Assembly. Political analyst Daniel Silke says this is a clear sign the ANC has given up on making considerable strides in the province on May 8th. He says, given the choice, party members will often opt for positions that offer more power. “The ANC grappled with the position of who should be in the province and who has spent enough time in opposition in the province.” He also said the ANC has shown no real growth in electoral support in the province over the past 10 years“Notwithstanding various controversies within the DA over the last year or so, there really is little indication to show that there has been substantial support for the ANC.” One well-known name that is high up on the party’s provincial list is that of former Premier, Ebrahim Rasool. Rasool is the current head of elections for the party in the Western Cape, and a former ambassador to Washington DC
