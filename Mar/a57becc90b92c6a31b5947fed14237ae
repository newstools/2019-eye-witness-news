A grade nine learner was stabbed in the chest at Rusthof Secondary School in Lwandle on Tuesday. CAPE TOWN - At least 17 children have been stabbed at Western Cape schools this year. A grade nine learner was stabbed in the chest at Rusthof Secondary School in Lwandle on Tuesday. The stabbing apparently played out after a grade eight learner lost money while gambling with a grade nine pupil. It’s the second school stabbing this week after a learner was wounded at Manenberg High School on Monday. This stabbing occurred during an alleged gang fight that included non-learners. Education MEC's spokesperson Jessica Shelver said: “We are obviously extremely concerned that this is the second stabbing this week. We really do everything that we can to try and ensure that our schools remain weapon and drug-free zones. We really do need the support of parents and the community.” The department has confirmed the Lwandle stabbing victim is recovering in hospital. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
