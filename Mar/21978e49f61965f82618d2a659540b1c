The new increase will come into effect on Friday, the same day that the DA is planning to march against the move. Party leader Mmusi Maimane said that he has written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete for Parliament to reconvene urgently and for an ad hoc committee to be established to look into the matter. Maimane said that there was an urgent need to devise a plan that will work for all South Africans. “Why are asking the people of this country, who are already saddled with high costs of living, to finance an entity that is failing, to a government that is without a plan. We demand action and we demand change, therefore we will be gathering together on Friday across the country.”
