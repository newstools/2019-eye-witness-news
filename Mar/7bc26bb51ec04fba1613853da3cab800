JOHANNESBURG - Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has sparked a huge row in an IPL match between the Rajasthan Royals and the Kings XI Punjab when he 'Mankad' England batsman Jos Buttler. The dismissal is named after Indian all-rounder Vinoo Mankad, who twice ran out Bill Brown at the bowler's end during India's tour of Australia in 1947. Ashwin ran Buttler out at the non-strikers end in his delivery stride which has divided opinion among many past and present cricketers on social media. Former Australian leg spinner Shane Warne was the most critical of Ashwinâ€™s actions, saying that they were not in the spirit of the game, while veteran Indian broadcaster Harsha Bhogle says that Ashwin acted within the laws of the game. Nothing Wrong here, Everyone wants a Victoryas per ICC rules its completely correct decision by Ravi Ashwin pic.twitter.com/FuegU1dvYn  So disappointed in @ashwinravi99 as a Captain & as a person. All captains sign the #IPL wall & agree to play in the spirit of the game. RA had no intention of delivering the ball - so it should have been called a dead ball. Over to u BCCI - this a not a good look for the #IPL  Lots of drama on the Buttler run-out. He was livid but the law and the advisory on it is clear. The bowler is within his right to run a player out at the non-striker's end if he is out of his crease  Additional reporting by AFP.
