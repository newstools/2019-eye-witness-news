The party’s security cluster said this on Sunday in a briefing at Luthuli House on security and stability. But it has stressed that it’s not xenophobic. Speaking on border control issues, Home Affairs Minister Siyabonga Cwele said the ANC was committed to ensuring that foreign nationals received support in getting legal documentation.
