CAPE TOWN - The young lion who escaped from the Karoo National Park last month has now been tagged with a monitoring device. Officials aren't taking chances after the animal went on a weeklong walkabout before being caught this week. He had to spend a night behind bars for his feline offence. The lion was kept in a holding cell at the Sutherland police station after being captured and sedated. SANParks spokesperson Reynold Thakhuli said: “We have other lions in the park. The majority of them have been collared so that we can track them if they leave the park.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
