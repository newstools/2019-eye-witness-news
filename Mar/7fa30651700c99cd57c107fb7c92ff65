We intend to arrest the suspects within 72 hours.” Masha said video footage will also assist police in their investigation. “We’re still going to work on them and use resources that we have, as police, to ensure that we find and arrest the suspects as soon as possible.” The principal of Mondeor High School, who was one of the first people on the scene, said she’s distraught. She said Mathebula was still alive when she arrived but was not able to speak in his final moments.

Five of those gunned down in the grade school were children, 17 others, mostly pupils, were wounded in the attack.
