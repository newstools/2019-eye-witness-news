Nigerian cement mogul Aliko Dangote, worth $13,8 billion, retained his place as Africa’s wealthiest man.

It says that Amazon’s Jeff Bizos, worth $112 billion, remains the world’s richest man. At 21, Kylie Jenner is the youngest self-made billionaire. Dangote leaves the 25 African billionaires in his wake. His compatriot Mike Adenuga, worth $9,2 billion, is the second richest African. Nicky Oppeheimer, worth $7,3 billion, is third on the African list. Other South Africans mentioned are Patrice Motsepe, Johan Rupert, Koos Bekker and Michiel le Roux.
