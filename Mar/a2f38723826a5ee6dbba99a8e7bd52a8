Company secretary Lindikhaya Zide and chief information officer Chris Mbatha have been put on special leave. JOHANNESBURG - Four Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) executives have been placed on suspension or special leave over allegations of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure at the rail agency. The board, chaired by Khanyisile Kweyama, made the announcement on Friday. Company secretary Lindikhaya Zide and chief information officer Chris Mbatha have been put on special leave. The CEO of Corporate Real Estate Solutions Tara Ngubane and the general manager of Enterprise Risk Tumi Mohube have been suspended. Prasa's group chief executive officer Sipho Sithole: “Four of our senior executives have been either put on special leave or suspension due to various issues that they have to answer following a fair disciplinary process.” Kweyama said they will ensure the implicated employees are given a fair chance to answer to the allegations they are facing. She said the extent of improper, fruitless and wasteful expenditure, as reported by various independent bodies, shows a disturbing culture of impunity which must be stamped out. Prasa's annual report for 2016/2017 showed it was on a brink of financial collapse and that it was shedding millions of commuters who were losing confidence in its service. The agency said it hoped that this action will help strengthen the institution. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
