President Cyril Ramaphosa travelled with residents from Soshanguve to Tshwane central on Monday, with the 50 kilometer trip lasting more than three hours due to technical faults. PRETORIA - President Cyril Ramaphosa gave train commuters an undertaking that he would make sure state-owned rail agency Prasa pulled up it socks and improve what he called unacceptable service at train stations. Ramaphosa travelled with residents from Soshanguve to Tshwane central on Monday, with the 50 kilometer trip lasting more than three hours due to technical faults. The president said he was appalled by the late arrival of the locomotives, as well as the general lack of security and service. "We saw for ourselves how bad the train service is." Ramaphosa wanted to experience what thousands of South Africans go through when they travel to work during peak traffic.     The president, with Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the ANCâ€™s election campaign head Fikile Mbalula were stuck on the train, which arrived late at Mabopane station in Soshanguve and was three hours late to reach the Pretoria station. Ramaphosa said this was unacceptable. "We cannot accept it. In a period of renewal, we are repairing things, we are putting things right, so this is one of those things that must be put right." He also raised issues regarding a lack of security, the shocking state of bathrooms, overcrowded trains and other services. The president said he would urgently speak to Prasa to ensure these problems were addressed throughout the country.
