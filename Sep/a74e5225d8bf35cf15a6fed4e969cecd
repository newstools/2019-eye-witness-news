JOHANNESBURG - The state capture inquiry is hearing more testimony from former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Motsoeneng said the media was discrediting him by reporting on the Wits Business School tweet that denies that he lectured there. He told the inquiry on Tuesday that he lectured at Wits to show that he was educated but the school quickly responded, saying he was invited only once as a guest speaker. Motsoeneng also said while he decided that the destruction of property should not be shown on TV, he did not intend to ban coverage of protests altogether.
