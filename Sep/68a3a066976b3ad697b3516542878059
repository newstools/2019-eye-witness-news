The record-breaking artwork was displayed at Sandton City. LENASIA - South African artist Percy Maimela has become a Guinness World Record holder after creating the largest coffee mosaic in the world. Maimela created a picture of popular South African DJ Black Coffee using nothing but coffee grounds. The record-breaking artwork was displayed at Sandton City. Maimela said every person had the potential to learn certain skills to grow themselves. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about all of us using our potential to create what we can. I am an artist but someone else might be a soccer player. If you're a soccer player, for example, focus on what you‚Äôre doing and ensure you‚Äôre enjoying it.‚Äù Today is the last day to see this Guinness world record art installation. Let's meet at Sandton City for pictures between 1pm and 5pm. Holla if you are around the mall. #guinnessworldrecord #coffeeart #blackcoffee #percymaimela #artist A post shared by  Percy Maimela Art (@percy_maimela) on Sep 14, 2019 at 2:02am PDT  A painful moment as @dean857 CEO of Brainfarm and I had to destroy a @guinnessworldrecords portrait of @realblackcoffee done with #coffee grounds at @sandtoncitymall.
