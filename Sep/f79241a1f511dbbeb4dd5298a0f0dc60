Workers in the banking sector were angry at looming job losses brought by increasing reliance on technology. JOHANNESBURG – The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and Sasbo on Thursday said they would appeal the Labour Court ruling interdicting a planned banking sector strike on Friday. The urgent application was brought by Business Unity South Africa, which argued the correct channels were not followed to embark on the nationwide action. Workers in the banking sector were angry at looming job losses brought by increasing reliance on technology. Cosatu and Sasbo were dealt a blow but they said they would not give up. The trade union federation’s deputy general secretary Solly Phetoe said they would re-submit an urgent appeal to the Labour Court. Sasbo’s general secretary Joe Kokela said they would not sit back while workers were being exploited in the banking sector. The unions plan to take to the streets on 7 October. ‘TEMPORARY VICTORY FOR BUSINESS’ Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali described the Labour Court outcome as a bad judgment, which was flawed in law. He explained on the side-lines of the Nedlac Summit in Sandton that the federation had done everything right as per Nedlac protocols for acquiring a Section 77 strike certificate. He even insisted that Nedlac confirmed the federation was compliant. Ntshalintshali said they would not only appeal the ruling but also resubmit another Section 77 application because the problems plaguing workers, especially in the finance sector, had not gone away. “It’s just a postponement and a temporary victory for business. We are not going to disband; we are going to move forward and mobilise our members. In fact, this clearly indicates that the financial sector in this case careless about workers,” he said.
