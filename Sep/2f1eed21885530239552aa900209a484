The High Court in Johannesburg has dismissed the contempt of court charge against AfriForum's Ernst Roets. JOHANNESBURG - The High Court in Johannesburg has ruled that AfriForum's Ernst Roets did not break the law when he posted a picture of the apartheid flag just hours after the Equality Court had ruled that its gratuitous display amounted to hate speech. The application was brought by the Nelson Mandela Foundation saying that Roets was in contempt of court. But deputy CEO of AfriForum argued that the display of the old flag could still be used for artistic, journalist and academic purposes. Judge Collin Lamont made the ruling this morning: “I accordingly form the view that the second respondent may in due course have breached the provisions of the Equality Act. There is no contempt of the court order. My view is that there was no contempt established of the order. This, however, is not the end of the matter, as the Equality Court has full powers to deal with the matter and full powers of imposing what it believes is an appropriate sanction for conduct which breaches that Act.”
