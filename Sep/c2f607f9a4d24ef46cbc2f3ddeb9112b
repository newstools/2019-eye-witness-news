She had stopped to help a motorist whose car had overturned but her vehicle ended up being struck by a truck. Dlamini said Hlongwa was prepared to die for the issues she was passionate about. “She strongly believed in the struggle for the emancipation of women.” Hlongwa’s friend and comrade Precious Banda has described her as a champion of women and the marginalised. “She stood with victims and families of survivors. Even on her last day, she spoke about it on social media. She believed that young women could not forever be deputised and that’s why she dreamt about becoming the president of the ANC one day.” Hlongwa is survived by her mother, five siblings and four adopted children.
