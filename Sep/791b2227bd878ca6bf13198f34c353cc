CAPE TOWN - Former and current District Six residents have been reminded of the pain and joy of the past at the renaming of Keizersgracht Street. After a ceremony and an official unveiling earlier on Tuesday, it's now called Hanover Street; the name it bore before forced removals in the 1960s during apartheid. The name change was approved during a full council sitting earlier this year after the District Six working committee made a request to change it. Some residents forced out of District Six during apartheid have cried tears of joy during the renaming ceremony while others shed tears of sadness, saying hurtful memories of the day their families were forcibly removed from their homes came flooding back. #DistrictSix #HanoverStreet The Cape Town CBD has come alive with singing, dancing and celebration.

They were fighting against each other and we would go and check them fighting. It was nice, we missed District Six. Our neighbours cried when we moved out, we were like family.” #DistrictSix #HanoverResident 92-year-old Johaar Mosoval was born in the historic community. He says he can’t explain the joy he feels....he recalls his favourite shops that lined the street. LI pic.twitter.com/E14Ab538B7
