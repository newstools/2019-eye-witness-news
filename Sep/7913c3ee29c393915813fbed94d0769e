JOHANNESBURG - Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng said that the media was discrediting him by reporting on the Wits Business School tweet that denies that he lectured there. Motsoeneng is continuing his testimony at the state capture commission of inquiry on Wednesday. He told the inquiry on Tuesday that he lectured at Wits to show that he was educated but the school quickly responded saying that he was invited only once, as a guest speaker.  But Motsoeneng said that he had lectured there at least three times and the SABC even reported on this but the media was not telling that story. "I think their role is to discredit me even now because yesterday, I spoke about lecturing at Wits Business School... it is true chairperson, I have the documents, I will produce them. I was invited... it doesn't mean that when I was lecturing that I was employed but they twisted what I said." Meanwhile, Motsoeneng said that while he decided that the destruction of property should not be shown on TV, he did not intend to ban coverage of protests altogether. He said the decision to ban visuals showing the destruction of public property was to discourage protests which were on the rise and those who were demanding to be filmed. Inquiry chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo continued to question Motsoeneng on the decisions. “If you take what the Labour Court says, with due respect chairperson, I submit that by calling it a policy it was wrong because it was a decision not a policy,” he said.
