We call on the police to do everything in their power to apprehend these faceless individuals. This act against the school is a violation of a fundamental human right and undermines our transformation agenda,” Lesufi said in a statement. “This act will not deter us from our agenda of transforming the education system. Vandalism targeted at our schools requires the urgent attention of all structures of civil society and our partners in the education sector.” The MEC Lesufi also called on communities to protect schools and assist the police in this incident. “We strongly condemn any acts of criminality & the disruption of schooling, which seek to undermine the dignity of both learners and educators.” WATCH: Hoërskool HF Verwoerd renamed
