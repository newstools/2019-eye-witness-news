A brace from Moroccan striker Achraf Bencharki and another strike from Youssef Ibrahim completed an emphatic 3-0 win over Pyramids FC in Alexandria on Sunday night. JOHANNESBURG - Itâ€™s taken less than a month for Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic to make his mark at Zamalek as his new team won the Egyptian Cup. A brace from Moroccan striker Achraf Bencharki and another strike from Youssef Ibrahim completed an emphatic 3-0 win over Pyramids FC in Alexandria on Sunday night. The win brings to an end what has been a barren two seasons for the former Orlando Pirates coach, who failed to win a single trophy during his spell at the club. Taking to Twitter to reflect on his success, Micho expressed his pride at winning his 16th major trophy in five different countries.  Micho also praised the work put in by his technical team and players in the four games that he has been in charge of the club.
