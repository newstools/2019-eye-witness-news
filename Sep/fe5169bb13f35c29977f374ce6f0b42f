The NPA says both parties came to an agreement to settle the matter out of court. CAPE TOWN - Sexual assault charges against politician Marius Fransman  have been withdrawn. The NPA said that both parties came to an agreement to settle the matter out of court. Wednesday's court proceedings in Kimberley brought to an end a four-year case. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phaladi Shuping said lawyers for Fransman and Louisa Wynand met and decided that all charges be withdrawn. “All the parties that were involved in the matter, they got together and reached an agreement that all the charges should be withdrawn.” Fransman is the former chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape. He was accused of sexually assaulting his former personal assistant in 2016 when they travelled to the ANC’s 8 January celebrations in the North West. In 2016, it led to his suspension from the ANC for five years.
