Democratic Alliance (DA) leaderMaimane made the announcement at a Heritage Day celebration at the Nelson Mandela Museum in Orlando, Soweto. SOWETO - Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said he would soon launch, what he called, a jobs and justice fund. Maimane made the announcement at a Heritage Day celebration at the Nelson Mandela Museum in Orlando, Soweto. He was joined by senior party leaders to celebrate the day. The latest stats showed that around 29% of South Africans were unemployed. In his Heritage Day message, Maimane said it was unacceptable that many South Africans were not taking part in the economy. "I want to set up a job and justice fund that will ensure we build a reconciled South Africa, so that those who are left out because of poverty, will know that justice will be served and we will create a fund that gives them opportunities." Maimane also lashed out at Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. Earlier Lesufi slammed the building of a new Afrikaans university, saying it reminded him of apartheid. However, Maimane said Lesufiâ€™s message was divisive, saying the MEC was displaying his open hatred towards Afrikaans.
