The latest crime figures showed an increase in contact crimes such as murder, sexual offences and robbery with aggravating circumstance. CAPE TOWN - The latest crime statistics were not very rosy said Police Minister Bheki Cele, with murders having increased by 3.4%. Cele and a delegation of police officials presented the 2018/2019 crime stats to Parliament's police portfolio committee on Thursday morning. The figures showed an increase in contact crimes such as murder, sexual offences and robbery with aggravating circumstance. Between April last year and March this year 21,022 were killed, which was an increase of 686 murders - this means the murder rate has gone up by 3.4% That's about 58 murders a day. Sexual offences are also on the rise having increased by 2,312 cases or 4.4%. Major-General Norman Sekhukhune: "So in the current financial year, the murder statistics that we have reported is 21,022. When we compare this to the previous financial year, which is 20,336 there is an increase of 686 murders within this current reference period." Bheki Cele said what was most concerning was that most murders were committed by people who were known to victims. "A very high number of people are murdered by the people that they know. The case in Mpumalanga at the moment, of the four kids murdered by their mother... all those cases are registered as murder." The police will be back in Parliament next week to respond to questions and analySe the statistics further.
