Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng was justifying why he continued to rise even as various letters were written to him to get his matric qualification. JOHANNESBURG - Former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng has the state capture commission in stitches as he tries to convince Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that his talent was more important than education in broadcasting. Motsoeneng is on Tuesday responding to the allegations made against him by other witnesses at the state capture inquiry. He was justifying why he continued to rise even as various letters were written to him to get his matric qualification. He said some of the people who conduct interviews at the public broadcaster were clueless and that it was talent and not degrees that drew audiences. “People who are actors in your soapies and dramas, some of them don’t even have matric. I think even judges watch these people and they’re so excited.” Motsoeneng said like him, there were many at the SABC who didn’t have matric qualifications. He said the media and the Public Protector misconstrued his position. “There are many people at the SABC who don’t have matric, talent is more important,” he said. He insisted it wasn’t his fault that SABC files stated that he had standard 10 (matric). “Marie Swanepoel, by writing outstanding matric, confirmed this. When I came from Pretoria saying I don’t have matric, HR was supposed to remove this.”
