Ipid investigator Innocent Khuba made this submission at the state capture commission of inquiry on Friday. JOHANNESBURG - Former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko has been accused of suspending former Ipid head Robert McBride and then using the acting head to execute a campaign to remove key people from the watchdog body. Ipid investigator Innocent Khuba made this submission at the state capture commission of inquiry on Friday. He said after Israel Kgamanyane was appointed to act in McBride’s position, he was used as a tool to carry out an agenda. Khuba referred to an earlier call with Nhleko where he was told to co-operate with an investigation, which was aimed at having McBride dismissed. “Previously I had received a call from the minister. I realised that the acting executive was probably just an instrument to achieve that goal.” WATCH: State capture inquiry proceedings on 27 September 2019  HOME VISIT The state capture commission heard how Khuba was visited by several Hawks officials, who offered to get him his job back if he submitted an affidavit which implicated McBride in wrongdoing. He detailed how he was fired for not giving in to pressure to implicate McBride and fellow investigator Matthews Sesoko during internal disciplinary proceedings. He said after being dismissed, he was approached by senior Hawks officials from the unit’s crimes against the state unit. Khuba alleged that they paid him a visit at home. “They moved around the sitting room. They checked the house and they said, ‘You have such a big house. It might be expensive to pay on a monthly basis. You have a beautiful car and now that you’re not working it might be very difficult to pay. The house is nice, but how will you pay for it? We know you’re not working’.” He said when the officers finally sat down to talk, they got straight to the point. “That is when he said, ‘We want you to make a statement that will implicate Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko.’ They were very direct. They did not duck and dive.”
