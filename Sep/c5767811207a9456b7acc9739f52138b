MITCHELLS PLAIN - Relatives of murdered Philippi teenager Janika Mello said they couldn't believe something so tragic could happen to a friendly, humble girl. Family members, learners and teachers gathered at Northwood Primary in Mitchells Plain earlier on Wednesday to remember the 14-year-old. The girl's body was found in her grandmother's backyard in Heinz Park on Sunday morning. Her smile, that's what Mello's father, Marlon Koopman would miss the most. “For this, I don’t have answers. For me, it’s still a dream. I just want to wake up and everything is over,” the father said. The teenager's classmates paid an emotional tribute to her: “We love you Janika and we wanted to write a letter to you. We love you and we hope you will rest in peace.” Police said they were working around the clock to find Mello’s killers.
