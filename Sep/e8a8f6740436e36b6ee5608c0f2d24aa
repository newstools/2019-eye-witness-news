CAPE TOWN - Police are investigating varying motives behind a slew of attacks on trucks in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Last Monday, four trucks came under attack in separate incidents on the N2 and N7. There've also been attacks on truckers in KZN. The police's Vish Naidoo said: “In other cases, like the N2 incident in the Western Cape, [there] was a protest action where they were protesting on the land invasion issue and there was a truck that was attacked and subsequently looted. So that we know is pure criminality.” Naidoo added that the investigations into all the incidents were progressing well: "We are at a very advanced stage of our investigation. Those ones we know exactly what motivated them, we know what we’re looking for and it’s just a question now of arresting those who are responsible."
