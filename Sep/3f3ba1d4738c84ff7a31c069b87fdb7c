CPS approached the Supreme Court of Appeal to challenge the ruling handed down by the High Court in Pretoria. JOHANNESBURG - Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) has on Monday lost its bid to appeal a High Court decision to pay back R316 million from the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). CPS approached the Supreme Court of Appeal to challenge the ruling handed down by the High Court in Pretoria. The money was irregularly paid to the company in 2014. Corruption Watch then launched the legal action against CPS and Sassa. CPS has been ordered to pay the legal costs for Corruption Watch. Meanwhile, Sassa has welcomed the SCA’s judgment, ordering CPS to pay back over R300 million. Sassa’s Paseka Letsatsi said: "Our leaders are studying certain parts of the judgment. Remember when a judgment is passed, certain things need to be implemented, especially from Sassa’s side."
