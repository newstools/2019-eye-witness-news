Activist Lucinda Evans said she’s not waiting for change, she is demanding change. “In 1956 women struggled to come together for the liberation of this country. In 2019 it is the same call to come together.” Their list of grievances pertains to victim support, human trafficking, the national register for sex offenders’ registry and more. Minister of women Maite Nkoana-Mashabane addressed the crowd and accepted their memorandum of demands.“Women can no longer walk safe in the streets. You braved the rain because it is raining blood of our children.”
