TK pic.twitter.com/xRcL29Fird  He had pleaded guilty at the beginning of his trial to raping a seven-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in September last year in Silverton. But the State continued with the trial to challenge Ninow's version of events, arguing that the rape was premeditated. The State called eight witnesses last week, including the little girl and her mother, as well as former Dros employees. Judge Papi Mosopa delivered his verdict on Monday morning. “[On the charge of] Rape, you are found guilty, possession of drugs you are found guilty, assault you are not found guilty, defeating or obstructing the ends of the administration of justice you are found guilty.” Mosopa rejected Ninow's version of events about what happened on 22 September last year in a Dros bathroom. He said the convicted rapist did not suffer from mental illness to not recognise that his actions were wrong.Mosopa said there was also no explanation as to why Ninow went to the female toilets while there was a designated facility for males. The courtroom was packed to capacity with civil society groups and members of various political parties coming to hear the verdict. Sentencing proceedings will commence on 16 October.
