PROGRESS Police Minister Bheki Cele said cash-in-transit heists and car hijackings were considerably down compared to the previous year. He said during the 2017/2018 financial year, cash-in-transit heists were reported up to twice a day in some instances. He said this year, they have come down drastically from 238 previously to 183, which is a drop of 23.1%. “While we are not where we want to be, we are definitely not where we were the last time. We have recorded decreases in crimes of fear such as cash-in-transit, bank robberies, car and car hijacks as well as robberies in non-residential premises.” The latest stats also show how other fear crimes like bank robberies have also decreased from 13 previously to just four which signifies a 69.2% decrease. On murder, Cele said the only positive was how this year’s increase in murder is considerably lower compared to last year.
