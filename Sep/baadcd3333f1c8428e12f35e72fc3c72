The group met with the four ministers for a question and answer session, just a few minutes after President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed a march at the gates of Parliament. CAPE TOWN - Four Cabinet ministers have spent Thursday afternoon listening to a harrowing list of concerns from students and women about gender-based violence. Young women and university students from across Cape Town have called on government to do more to keep them safe. The group met with the ministers for a question and answer session, just a few minutes after President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed a march at the gates of Parliament. Cabinet ministers Lindiwe Sisulu, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, Maite Nkoana-Mashabana and Bheki Cele were all in attendance. The students packed the Imbizo Media Centre to tell the ministers about their fears and concerns. Some of them called for state-sponsored pepper spray to be given to all women while a longer-term solution is thought through. After police fired stun grenades and used water cannons on a womenâ€™s march in Cape Town on Wednesday, the students pleaded with Cele to stop the heavy-handedness. Some were even too emotional to address the ministers. Sisulu assured the audience that all their grievances and suggestions would be taken to Ramaphosa who is expected to address the nation on Thursday evening.
