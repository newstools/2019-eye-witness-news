CAPE TOWN - Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said she was alarmed by the murder of well-known female boxer Leighandre Jegels. She was shot dead last Friday and her mother was wounded in East London. A policeman, attached to the tactical reaction unit, has been arrested. Heâ€™s expected in court on Monday. Police watchdog Ipid is probing the shooting. In a statement, Nkoana-Mashabane said Jegels had made claims of domestic violence against the man. She and the suspect lived together until the boxer obtained a protection order against him. Jegels had been training for her return to the ring in a junior boxing bantamweight fight next month. The minister said more needed to be done to change the mentality that leads to violence against women.
