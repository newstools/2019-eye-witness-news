I have a challenge.” Moments later, Mchunu lost his balance, with officials rushing to the stage to help him as he collapsed. There were gasps throughout the room as dozens of guests tried to edge closer to the premier to pray. The KwaZulu-Natal premier has not been well for several months, which is part of the reason why Zikalala has been stepping in in an acting capacity during recent government events. Mchunu was attended to by paramedics who were on scene within minutes of his collapse. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
