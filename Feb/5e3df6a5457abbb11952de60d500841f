One other suspect was injured while two others were arrested. JOHANNESBURG - Police have confirmed that two suspects have been shot dead following a robbery at Edenvale High School on Thursday afternoon. One other suspect was injured while two others were arrested. An unknown number of suspects fled the scene in two cars. Police have also recovered three unlicensed firearms. At the same time, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has met with school management and police at the school. He says the staff at the admin centre were held at gunpoint: “They demanded the principal told them where the safe was. When they were pointed to where the safe was, I am told it was petty cash just around R8,000 that they have managed to lay their hands on. But fortunately, the school has a very strong security system, so the alarms were pressed and security arrived.” Meanwhile, school principal Larry Harmer has also given his version of events: “We saw them coming on the cameras, by the time of the lockdown, they were in front of the office window with their AK47s and pistols and they traumatised the front staff and demanded the safe and couldn’t see it. They then tried to access the offices and smash down my door.” In a separate incident, R25,000 was taken from Norkem Park High School in Kempton Park. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
