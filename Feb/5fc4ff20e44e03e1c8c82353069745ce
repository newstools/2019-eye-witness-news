Deputy prosecutions boss Willie Hofmeyr has linked advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to an apparent decline in serious corruption cases being instituted. PRETORIA - Deputy prosecutions boss Willie Hofmeyr  says there's been systematic attempts within the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) over the last seven years to avoid prosecuting senior politicians for corruption. Hofmeyr made the submission while being cross-examined at the Mokoro Commission of Inquiry in Centurion on Monday. The hearings have focused on the adverse findings made against Hofmeyr in the Supreme Court of Appeal spy tapes judgment. Hofmeyr has linked advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to an apparent decline in serious corruption cases being instituted. “But the brutal reality is that if I ask Mr Mrwebi and Ms Jiba which significant case [they had] in the last seven years, I think their answer would be zero.” He says the public’s lack of confidence in the NPA has had to do with the lack of action in relation to state capture. “I think there was a systematic attempt for the NPA not to charge senior corrupt politicians and it wasn’t because there was a lack of evidence or cases.” Jiba’s counsel strongly rejected Hofmeyr’s claims and accused him of making political speeches at this inquiry.
