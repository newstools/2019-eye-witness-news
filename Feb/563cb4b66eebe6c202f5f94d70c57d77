Eskom is implementing stage 4 load shedding as it needs to shed 4,000 megawatts urgently. CAPE TOWN - Power cuts are affecting certain traffic lights, which in turn is wreaking havoc at some intersections. Eskom is implementing stage 4 load shedding as it needs to shed 4,000 megawatts urgently. Customers will be scheduled for load shedding 12 times over a four day period for two hours at a time, or 12 times over an eight day period for four hours at a time. Western Cape traffic chief Kenny Africa has advised motorists to be patient. “We urge motorists to treat intersections where robots are not working as a four way stop. Give right of way to people on your right-hand side.” Meanwhile, energy expert Ted Blom says consumers can expect intermittent power cuts over the coming months, as the units are being worked on. “I expect it to get worse before it gets better. Eskom has been running on edge now for more than a year and a half.” Check your area's load shedding schedule here. View a load shedding data map on Cape Town here. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
