LISTEN: #LoadShedding woes: Eskom explains what's behind the power blackouts  In a statement, the board said it convened an urgent meeting with the company’s executive management and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. Following the meeting, the board has assured South Africans of a systems and operations update over the next 24 hours. “The board is urgently embarking on an in-depth audit of the entire system (Eskom’s new build programme) to ensure that every technical problem is understood at a granular level and to prevent unseen crises as seen today.” Eskom said it was uncomfortable about the stability of its generating units after escalating from stage 2 to stage 4 load shedding on Monday. By Monday night, Eskom said four units had returned to service and the remaining three would be up and running by Tuesday. The power utility, however, said stage four load shedding would remain in place. The board’s chairman, Jabu Mabuza, said: “We remain uncomfortable about the stability of the generating system, but will keep the country informed of our progress over the next few days in providing better assurance about electricity supply.” Residents and businesses have been urged to use electricity sparingly. #MEDIASTATEMENT BY THE ESKOM BOARDSPECIAL BOARD MEETING WITH MINISTER GORDHAN @SABCNewsOnline@ewnupdates@IOL @BDliveSA @chrisyelland @EngNewsZA @News24 @SowetanLIVE @DPE_ZA @eNCA @AntonEberhard @Fin24 @Moneyweb pic.twitter.com/n1Bkco0Peo  Check your area's load shedding schedule here.
