The outages are expected to last until about 10pm in the evening. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has deployed officers to help with the flow of traffic on Monday afternoon as the country battles stage 4 load shedding. The outages are expected to last until about 10pm. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said: “JMPD officers will be deployed to all the major intersections throughout Johannesburg this afternoon to assist with traffic flow and directing of traffic. Motorists are reminded to exercise patience and to treat traffic intersections as four-way stops where there are no traffic officers.” Eskom says 4,000 megawatts need to be shed from the national grid after six additional generating units went offline unexpectedly. Stage 4 doubles the frequency of stage 2 which means consumers will be scheduled for load shedding 12 times over a four day period for two hours at a time, or 12 times over an eight-day period for four hours at a time.
