“What made him closer to me was that his academic ability was not as strong as the other two, and he grew up a struggling fellow with asthma, so that brought him closer to me. We channelled our love and care to him.” JOHANNESBURG - Thoriso Themane’s father said his son was a loving man who was fond of music and helping people.

We channelled our love and care to him.” Themane senior said he would like to his son remembered as a peace-loving and musical man who would go out to help those that were in need. “He didn’t want to see anyone hurt.
