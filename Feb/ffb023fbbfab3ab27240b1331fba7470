The university receives its water supply from the Settlers Dam which is currently at 11% Makana Municipality Mayor Mzukisi Mpahlwa says they planning on linking two water systems to help. “We have a contingency plan to link the two systems together so that we can be able to share the water amongst the residents. That will result in us shutting down one side for a day or two and then the other side.” Meanwhile, Gift of the Giver's Imtiaz Sooliman says a donation of bottles of water is on its way: “We loaded two trucks with water over the weekend. We are loading the third one now. At the same time, we are loading two trucks in Johannesburg and one in Durban, hopefully by around 12 noon. All six trucks will arrive in Grahamstown with 250,000 litres.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
