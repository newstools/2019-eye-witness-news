In the third quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 27.5% with 6.2 million people without work. JOHANNESBURG – As Stats SA prepares to release the quarterly labour force survey on Tuesday, the unemployment rate is expected to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to seasonal factors. In the third quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 27.5% with 6.2 million people without work. Investec's Annabel Bishop says that the jobless rate is likely to drop slightly in the fourth quarter. “The December and festive season tend to see more additional employment from retailers, from shop assistants and obviously the tourism sector as well and that tend to see a little of a mild improvement. We’re not expecting to see a dramatic improvement.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
