A 16-year-old girl was allegedly bound with chains for three days as punishment and it’s also been reported the woman’s 15-year-old daughter was beaten daily. CAPE TOWN - A woman facing multiple charges of child abuse on a farm near Worcester will be back in court in March. The 52-year-old has made her second appearance in the local magistrates court on Wednesday. Last month, authorities found a teenager in her care chained around her neck. The woman’s lawyer could not attend court proceedings due to a personal matter and the case was postponed to 13 March. National Prosecuting Authority officials say a decision on whether the case will be moved to the regional court will be announced at the next appearance. The woman was arrested after police acted on a tip-off about alleged abuse on the woman’s farm in Scherpenheuwel. Twelve children were living with the accused. A 16-year-old girl was allegedly bound with chains for three days as punishment and it’s also been reported the woman’s 15-year-old daughter was beaten daily. The children have undergone medical examinations at Worcester Hospital.
