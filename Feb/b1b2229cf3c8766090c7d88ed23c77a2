JOHANNESBURG - Another South African student has been hurt during a confrontation with private security guards, this time at the University of Johannesburg (UJ)’s Auckland Park campus. It's understood the young man was hit by rocks on the head while students were pelting stones at police and private guards earlier on Wednesday. Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: “There was chaos when the students started to pelt stones at the police. The students wanted to force entry into the campus [and] rubber bullets and tear gas was used to disperse them.”   It’s the latest altercation between private guards and students. On Tuesday, a Durban University of Technology student was shot and later died in hospital after clashes broke out near the Steve Biko campus. Students at several universities are demanding that historical debt be cleared and that issues around NSFAS  and accommodation be addressed.
