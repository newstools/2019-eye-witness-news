JOHANNESBURG - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) says should it come into power after May's elections, the party will place service delivery as one of its main priorities. Party leader Bantu Holomisa launched the UDM’s manifesto in Nelson Mandela Bay on Saturday where he slammed the African National Congress for the unemployment in the area. •  Ramaphosa knows ANC not worthy of South Africans' trust, says Holomisa A report by Stats South Africa 2017 revealed more than 20,000 people were without jobs in the municipality.The party has vowed to upskill workers and improve service delivery in the region. Holomisa says civil service needs to be prioritised. “When the UDM comes to power, one of the first things we shall invest in is professionalising the civil service in order to deliver quality service. The appointment of director generals will be the sole responsibility of the Department of Public Service in consultation with the presidency.” The UDM says the ANC has caused nothing but damage to the country's institutions. Holomisa says the actions of the ruling party have rendered institutions, like Prasa and Eskom, dysfunctional. “We all know the damage it has done to our economy, safety, education and health system. We know the cost of state capture. Billions of rand have been stolen and many state agencies have been weakened.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
