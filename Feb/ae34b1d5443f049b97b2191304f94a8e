The DA leader mentioned allegations that came out of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture and the VBS Mutual Bank heist. JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Saturday officially launched its election manifesto at the Rand Stadium in Johannesburg ahead of national and provincial elections set for 8 May. DA leader Mmusi Maimane  criticised the African National Congress-led government over major corruption scandals. He mentioned allegations that came out of the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into state capture and the VBS Mutual Bank heist. Here’s are the seven quotes from the DA leader’s manifesto launch speech. 1. “Our leaders lost sight of our goal. They realised they could make money off every job, every contract and every purchase that involved the government. The posters still said 'a better life for all', but what we were starting to see was a better life for some.” “While millions didn’t have clean water to drink, some were drinking the finest champagnes up on stage.” “While many lived in RDP houses that collapsed if you leaned on them, others lived in palaces called Nkandla.” “Those who started out as liberators had ended up as tsotsis. And they were looting the Arms Deal, Bosasa and VBS while millions didn’t have money to get by. Corruption has stolen the dignity and the future of millions of our people.” “Our country was sold out by those who swore an oath to serve us. And, as we have just learnt in the Zondo Commission, they betrayed our struggle for a braai pack, some beers and a handbag.” “I know this is not an easy thing to admit. Turning away from the only party you’ve ever known is, for many South Africans, like giving up on a family member. But when that family member threatens your safety and the future of your children, then you are forced to make a tough decision.” “After 25 years of ANC rule, we are still told to ‘watch this space’. The reality is, we’ve run out of time to watch. We need to do. Right now.”
