North West is in the building, stand up South Africa! Things are really hotting up at the Rand Stadium.It's on. #DAmanifesto pic.twitter.com/TnjZ8EtmO9  Maimane says Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s Budget speech did not present a clear plan to stabilise the country’s finances and kickstart growth. Today, he’s promising to present such a plan when he launches the party’s election manifesto. The DA’s plan for stabilising the economy includes splitting Eskom into two entities, placing SAA under business rescue and selling off non-core state-owned enterprises. It says the size of Cabinet must be reduced to contain the public sector wage bill which now accounts for 34 percent of government spend. The party says it’s also against land expropriation without compensation and wants to see the Mining Charter scrapped. (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
