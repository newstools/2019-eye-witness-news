DURBAN - Mlungisi Madonsela has been described as a friend who was always willing to help those in need. Madonsela, aged 21, died in hospital exactly a week ago after he was caught in the crossfire between authorities and protesting students at the Durban University of Technology. Its alleged that a private security guard fired the shot that killed the 3rd year student. Madonsela’s friends have described him as a brother whose only sin was to “fight for the black child” whose future rests on the delivery of free education at tertiary institutions. One student and friend Thabiso Mndayi has read out an open letter to the institution, saying it’s clear that the free education they were promised won’t come on a silver platter. Madonsela’s emotional friends spoke about how untimely his passing was and they’ve promised to continue the fight that he’s started. The 21-year-old man’s family was seated in front of the podium, as they listened to different accounts of how their loved one was always willing to lend a helping hand, especially to poor students.
