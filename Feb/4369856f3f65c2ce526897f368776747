SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana said the firm will be split into domestic, regional and international business units, each with their own management. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s struggling state-owned airline (SAA) is to break into three business units as part of a restructuring plan, its chief executive Vuyani Jarana said on Monday. Jarana said the firm - which has not made a profit since 2011 and was given a R5 billion bailout last year to shore up its balance sheet - will be split into domestic, regional and international business units, each with their own management. However, SAA spokesperson Tladi Tladi says a final decision has not been taken. “There is no decision to break the airline into three separate entities. It’s about the internal reconfiguration of resources to bring more accountability and more efficiency in terms of our operations.” LISTEN: SAA wants to reclaim Africa’s No. 1 airliner spot
