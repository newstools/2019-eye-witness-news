CAPE TOWN - The Sharks are in Singapore ahead of the opening 2019 Super Rugby fixture against the Sunwolves, looking to get the season off to a positive and successful start on Saturday.

Other than that, there are no surprises in the team named to front up to the Sunwolves. Louis Schreuder, who missed last Saturdayâ€™s game due to illness, has returned and will lead the side on Saturday. Aphelele Fassi, one of four youngsters making their debuts on Saturday, will start at fullback with Kerron van Vuuren, Khutha Mchunu and Phendulani Buthelezi all coming off the bench, having earned their positions in the match 23 following outstanding performances against the Lions and Bulls in the two pre-season hit-outs.
