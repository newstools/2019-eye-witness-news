Fita Khupe is accused of killing seven members of the same family in Vlakfontein in October last year and burying them at their home. JOHANNESBURG - Murder accused Fita Khupe has been denied bail at the Protea Magistrate's Court in Soweto on Monday. He is accused of murdering four children and three women in their home in Vlakfontein  in October last year. His co-accused Ernest Mabaso allegedly committed suicide in January while in police custody. Last week, his lawyer told the court that the State's case against his client was weakened by the death of his Mabaso. However, Mabaso had confessed to the killings and claimed that he was forced by Khupe to rape and kill the seven victims of the same family. Khupe had denied the allegations and maintains he was innocent because he was in Zimbabwe at the time of the murders.
