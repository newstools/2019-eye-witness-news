From Wednesday morning, motorists are paying 7 cents more for a litre of 93 and 95 octane. JOHANNESBURG – The Automobile Association (AA) says at this stage it's difficult to say  if the price of petrol will increase again anytime soon. From Wednesday morning, motorists are paying 7 cents more for a litre of 93 and 95 octane. But it's not all bad news, diesel is down between 1 and 2 cents a litre, while paraffin costs 5 cents less. The AA's Layton Beard explains: “It’s really difficult to say what’s going to happen to the fuel price at the end of February going into March. We do give a prediction in the middle of the month but again that normally does change in those two weeks before the end of the month anyway.”
