The controversial company had been marred by a string of allegations at the Zondo commission. JOHANNESBURG - A team of South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials is reportedly at Bosasa’s head office in Krugersdorp to execute a search and seizure warrant. News24 is reporting that the taxman’s newly-established Illicit Economy Unit obtained a warrant earlier on Friday. The controversial company had been marred by a string of allegations at the Zondo commission and announced earlier this week that it was undertaking voluntary liquidation. Sars has refused to confirm this at this stage, saying it cannot disclose the affairs of taxpayers. Earlier, workers were locked out of their offices while a liquidator met with management. Sars acting chief enforcement officer Viwe Mlenzana says: “We are looking into the issues that were raised at the state capture commission. Section 69 of the Tax Administration Act prohibits us from naming taxpayers we’re busy dealing with. At the same time, workers at the head office of African Global Operations, previously known as Bosasa, say they’ve been informed that they will only be paid until the end of March while a process to sell the company gets underway. In a leaked audio clip to Eyewitness News, during a meeting with employees and the liquidator, this worker demanded clarity on how long they will be receiving salaries at the embattled firm. “We’re not sure whether by the end of February, we’ll still be employed or not. People are not rude, they are just scared. Unless we allay the fears of those around here; what more about the units in Cape Town, North West or Limpopo.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
