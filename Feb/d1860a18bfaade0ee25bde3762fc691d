This comes after she told the commission that former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, introduced her to two other Gupta brothers and another businessman on that flight to China. JOHANNESBURG - The state capture commission has revealed that its own investigation contradicts the testimony of former African National Congress (ANC) MP Vytjie Mentor in relation to her official visit to China in 2010. Mentor testified last year that she met Gupta brother, Atul, in Beijing. She also told the commission that former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane, introduced her to two other Gupta brothers and another businessman on that flight to China. But as evidence leader Mahlape Sello explains, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has provided documents to the commission, proving otherwise. “According to the DTI record, therefore, Mr Atul Gupta was not part of that delegation according to this document.” The commission also contacted the Home Affairs Department to check if their records prove that Atul Gupta was indeed in China at the time. “According to the Department of Home Affairs, Mr Atul Gupta was in the country over the period 22-26 August 2010, which is when the DTI trip took place.” Despite this evidence, Mentor is sticking to her guns suggesting that Atul Gupta left South Africa undetected.
