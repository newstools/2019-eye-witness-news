CAPE TOWN- Monday marked the International Day of Women and Girls in Science. The day was implemented in 2015 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation to recognise the critical role women and girls play in science and technology. The Association of South African Women in Science and Engineering's Dr Taime Sylvester says its focus is to promote established female scientists, who young girls and aspiring scientists can look up to. “It is really important for us to empower young girls to pursue careers in science. We need to try and get women in this academic world to celebrity status. We need to talk in a very popular type of way about our work that will go a long way in promoting science careers among our young girls.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
