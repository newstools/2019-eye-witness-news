Mentor on Monday was back on the stand at the commission to be cross-examined by controversial businessman Fana Hlongwane and former President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane. JOHANNESBURG - Former African National Congress  MP Vytjie Mentor says she doesn't want to return to the state capture commission after her cross-examination, because her testimony has been difficult and has taken a great toll on her. Mentor on Monday was back on the stand at the commission to be cross-examined by controversial businessman Fana Hlongwane and former President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane, whom she's implicated in her testimony. The commission has so far focused on its own investigations into the veracity of her testimony. Mentor has been booked for two days to undergo cross-examination. So far, the commission has presented evidence to her arising from its own investigations, which contradict some parts of her testimony. She’s appealed to the commission to be mindful of the time. “I don’t know if anybody feels what I feel as a whistle-blower on state capture. I’ve carried a lot of weight on my shoulders and I would like tomorrow to go home and reflect.” Mentor says the last few months have been difficult for her. “It takes a great toll on me. Today I came here thinking this will be the last two days of my appearance to assist this commission and I want to give it my all. I want to be given enough time so that I don’t have to return here because it has been a difficult task.” She says she just wants to conclude the cross-examination and go home and pray for the commission to complete its work.
