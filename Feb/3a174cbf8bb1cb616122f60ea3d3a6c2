The commission used records it obtained from the Departments of Home Affairs and Trade and Industry to prove that Atul Gupta was not part of a state visit to China as initially claimed by Mentor. JOHANNESBURG - The state capture commission has challenged parts of Vytjie Mentor's testimony, saying its own investigations contradict the claims she's made at the inquiry. The former African National Congress MP appeared returned to the inquiry on Monday for cross-examination. The commission used records it obtained from the Departments of Home Affairs and Trade and Industry to prove that Atul Gupta was not part of a state visit to China, as initially claimed by Mentor. She's also conceded at the commission that she travelled to China via the United Arab Emirates and not Hong Kong, as she previously stated. Central to Mentor’s testimony is that she travelled on an South African Airways (SAA) flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg on a Monday, between September and October of 2010 where she was taken to the Guptas home and offered the job of Public Enterprises minister while Jacob Zuma was in another room. The inquiry’s evidence leader, Mohlape Sello, said: “We cannot find a record of a flight on SAA you took from Cape Town to Johannesburg and back to Cape Town.” But Mentor insists she checked in at SAA: “I still maintain that when I checked in that morning, I checked into SAA. I maintain that I travelled on a Monday morning and was taken to Saxonwold and met the president.” The commission says it will now invite officials from Parliament and SAA to testify on this.
