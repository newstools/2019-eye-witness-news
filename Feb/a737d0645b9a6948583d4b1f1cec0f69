The pair has been suspended pending the outcome of the hearings. CAPE TOWN - The disciplinary hearings of a pupil and teacher from Sans Souci Girls' High involved in a violent altercation has been set down for next week. The pair has been suspended pending the outcome of the hearings. Lawyers representing the pupil have lodged a complaint with the Equality Court against the teacher for the violation of her rights to equality and freedom from harassment. They are both in hot water after a video went viral, showing the teacher smacking the 16-year old girl in the face. Provincial education MEC spokesperson Jessica Shelver says the teacher's lawyers have called for a postponement of the case. “The learner will remain suspended in the meantime, with regards to the teacher, she has required a postponement.”
