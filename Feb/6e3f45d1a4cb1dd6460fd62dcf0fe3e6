The Nugent Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration and Governance at Sars found former Sars boss Tom Moyane unfit to hold office and recommended he be sacked. JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has raised concerns over the process of appointing a new South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner, saying that it is being done in a secretive and suspicious manner. The Nugent commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance at Sars found former Sars boss Tom Moyane unfit to hold office and recommended he be sacked. The red berets now claim there were attempts to elect an incompetent and unqualified person to head the revenue collector. Retired Judge Robert Nugent says that politics should stay out of the appointment of the South African Revenue Services (Sars) commissioner. Nugent was briefing MPs on the findings and recommendations of the commission of inquiry he headed up to look into administration and governance at the revenue collector. He’s told Parliament’s standing committee on finance of what he calls the "massive failure" of governance at Sars under former commissioner Tom Moyane. Judge Robert Nugent’s remarks come after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni recently appointed a high-level panel to interview and recommend candidates for the position of Sars commissioner. The panel will be headed by former finance minister Trevor Manuel. Nugent says ideally, the head of Sars should not be a political appointment. "This should not be a political appointment. You politicians can choose your battlegrounds in other areas but leave Sars out of it. Sars must not be a political battleground." He’s also told MPs that former Sars head Tom Moyane had to go, saying he had dismantled governance at the institution almost from the moment he started. Additional reporting by Babalo Ndenze.
