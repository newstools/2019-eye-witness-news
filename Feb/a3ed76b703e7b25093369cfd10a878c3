JOHANNESBURG - South Africans are looking to President Cyril Ramaphosa for answers after the latest round of load shedding; the most severe to hit the country. Eskom says it had no choice but to implement stage 4 load shedding on Monday after an urgent need to shed 4,000 megawatts off the grid. Stage 4 load shedding has never been implemented before, and this drastic measure by Eskom took the country by surprise.
