Thirty-year-old Kuliswa Nondala was gunned down inside her home in the TR Section informal settlement over the weekend. CAPE TOWN - The Khayelitsha Development Forum says residents in Site C are heartbroken and angry, as they mourn the death of a well-known Economic Freedom Fighters  activist and community leader. Thirty-year-old Kuliswa Nondala was gunned down inside her home in the TR Section informal settlement over the weekend. The motive for her killing is unknown at this stage. The Khayelitsha Development Forum's Ndithini Tyhido has described Nondala as a smart, feisty and energetic young woman who fought for her community. “I’ve had interactions with Kuliswa on matters that affected the community, such as the issue of crime in the TR Section. It is quite sad that people like her are the ones who are targeted by these criminals in our communities.” The 30-year-old mother was shot in the upper body and declared dead on the scene. Her boyfriend, who was with her at the time of the shooting, had his cellphone stolen. It's understood two men entered Nondala's home last week and stole a plasma TV. It's not clear whether the incidents are linked. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
