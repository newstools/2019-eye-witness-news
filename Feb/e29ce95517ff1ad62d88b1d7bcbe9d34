Brickz, whose real name is Sipho Ndlovu, is serving a 15-year sentence for rape at a West Rand correctional services facility. CAPE TOWN – DJ Cleo has landed himself in hot water with some fans after sharing a social media post which appears to support convicted rapist Sipho “Brickz” Ndlovu. Ndlovu and Cleo, real name is Cleopas Monyepao, were reunited this week when a non-profit organisation, Humanitarian Empowerment Fund, hosted a sporting event as part of its rehabilitation efforts at a prison in West Rand. Local soccer players were also reportedly invited to event. Cleo’s tweet sparked outrage among social media users. He said: “We all run our own races, he fell along the way....but the race is not over (sic).”   Wow dj cleo. Just wow.  Dj Cleo should've just visited his convicted rapist friend and ease up on the faux motivation and sanitisation of the truth about what his friend really is, a RAPIST. You don't "fall" into being a rapist.  Dj cleo should delete that tweet. It wasn’t a mistake, Bricks raped a child for fucksakes.  Dj Cleo Can’t be serious,lol no ways  No lemme rephrase, DJ Cleo should've left himself at home.  Other fans praised the DJ for his post, and backed Cleo’s support of Brickz. Big up Dj Cleo👏👏👏  Thanx DJ, hape friends are few when days are dark. I’m sure he appreciated it very much .  We all make mistakes & we ain't perfect. He's paying for his. He must just be strong. Bricka mabrigado  The kwaito star was found guilty of raping his 16-year-old niece in his Ruimsig home on the West Rand in 2013.
