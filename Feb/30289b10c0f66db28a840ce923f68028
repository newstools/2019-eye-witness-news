Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schäfer says she is concerned about learners entering the school premises with weapons. She says they chose to do the random search at the school because there are frequent instances of violence and drug abuse. “We worked together with our Community Safety Department and SAPS. We have a number of interventions, as the Education Department, but other role players in the community also need to assist us.” #SchoolSafety Police found items including knives, screw drivers, dagga and cigarettes on learners in various grades at the school.

So, the message to all governing bodies is to make sure that you are requesting police to come in.” (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
