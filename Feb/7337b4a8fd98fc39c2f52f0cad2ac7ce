All three players started the opening game against Wales before missing Sunday’s 44-8 defeat by England at Twickenham. BENGALURU - France coach Jacques Brunel has given Wesley Fofana, Maxime Medard, and Uini Atonio a chance to prove their fitness after the trio were included in the 31-man training squad for the Six Nations clash against Scotland. All three players started the opening game against Wales before missing Sunday’s 44-8 defeat by England at Twickenham. Prop Atonio, who travelled to London with the team, has been struggling with a knee injury, while Fofana had a thigh strain and Medard needed an MRI on a shoulder problem. Brunel has chosen to stick with the same squad that featured in the first two matches of the tournament, despite facing criticism for a dismal defensive performance against England. With the title already well out of their reach, Les Bleus must now avoid defeat against Scotland at the Stade de France on 23 February if they do not want to play a ‘wooden spoon’ clash in Rome against Italy in their last outing.
