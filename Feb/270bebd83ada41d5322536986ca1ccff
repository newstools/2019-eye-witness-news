The party's Parliamentary Whip John Steenhuisen says the DA is the only party that's been putting up a real challenge to the ANC government, and exposing corruptions within its ranks. ‚Äú2018 wasn‚Äôt a great year for the DA but we have come into 2019 on the front foot, far more focused on the external environment and focused on issues that matter to South Africans and it‚Äôs represented in the manifesto.‚Äù (Edited by Refilwe Pitjeng)
