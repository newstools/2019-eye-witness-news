The victim sustained wounds to the arm, neck, and back after being attacked at his school in Manor outside of the Pietermaritzburg CBD. DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department says it's disturbed to hear that a 14-year-old pupil has been stabbed, allegedly by a classmate with a pair of scissors, marking the third such attack at a school in the province in just two weeks. The victim sustained wounds to the arm, neck, and back after being attacked at his school in Manor outside of the Pietermaritzburg CBD. KZN education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi says it’s worrying that instead of parents having to be concerned about what happens to their children outside of school, the pupils have themselves become a danger to one another. “These are very disturbing news because in just two weeks we another learner stabbed in one of the Pietermaritzburg schools last week. And just before now, there was another one in Durban.” Mahlambi says the department will investigate the matter but has also urged parents to ensure that their children don’t carry weapons to school. “It’s unfortunate [because] this case involves a pair of scissors, which is one of the instruments that we are using in schools.” The department says appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against the perpetrators.
