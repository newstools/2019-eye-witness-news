Hofmeyr was being questioned at the Mokgoro Inquiry about the adverse findings made against him in the supreme court of appeal’s spy tape judgement. PRETORIA - Deputy prosecutions boss Willie Hofmeyr says he regrets supporting the decision to withdraw criminal charges against former President Jacob Zuma, saying it’s something he will live with for a very long time. Hofmeyr was being questioned at the Mokgoro Inquiry about the adverse findings made against him in the Supreme Court of Appeal’s spy tape judgment. The court found that his statements were based on conjecture and supposition, adding he contradicted himself on several occasions. Hofmeyr says he’s accepted the Supreme Court of Appeal’s findings that he disregarded the evidence against Zuma. “I accept that I made a mistake by making so much value to not take it the NPA. I will live with that regret with a very long time.” Nomgcobo Jiba’s counsel, advocate Norman Arendse, suggested that his client was being treated unfairly considering the serious judicial criticism of Hofmeyr. Arendse says the criticism of Jiba pales in comparison to the criticism of Hofmeyr. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
