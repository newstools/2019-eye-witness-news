Load shedding will take place from 1pm until 10pm on Monday. This comes after the parastatal announced that it had lost six additional generating units. JOHANNESBURG - Power utility Eskom has announced it will be implementing stage 4 load shedding on Monday. The load shedding will take place from 1pm until 10pm. This comes after the parastatal announced that it had lost six additional generating units. Eskom will need to shed more than 4,000MW to keep the national grid from collapsing. What this means is the state-owned power utility starts additional, unscheduled power cuts wherever it needs to and outside of its schedules. This also means your area can be hit by blackouts at any time without any warning. The country hasnâ€™t reached this stage since 2008. Stage four will double the frequency  of stage two, which means you will be scheduled for load shedding 12 times over a four-day period for two hours at a time, or 12 times over an eight-day period for four hours at a time. Stage four load shedding is the final option for Eskom to prevent a national blackout.
