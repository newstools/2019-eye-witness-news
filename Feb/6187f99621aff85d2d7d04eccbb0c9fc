Young girl catches Ramaphosa’s attention during Khayelitsha visit Ramaphosa responded to 20 questions posed by people in the crowd who jumped from their seats, stretching their hands high, eager to get selected to address the president about their concerns.  One of the questions came from an employee at Wesgro, who raised concerns about Cape Town's rail infrastructure, which he says has been falling apart for many years. In response, Ramaphosa assured the crowd that government is working on straightening out the Passenger Rail Agency. “Transport infrastructure is a top priority for us, particularly as we want to get our economy to grow at higher levels.”  Ramaphosa also promised to meet with the Rural and Farmworkers Development Organisation whose spokesperson, Billy Claasen, raised an issue about the ill treatment of farm workers in the Western Cape. Ramaphosa says it's unacceptable that some farm labourers are still being treated as if they are less than human.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
