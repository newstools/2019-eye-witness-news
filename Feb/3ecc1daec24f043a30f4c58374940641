CAPE TOWN - Four men were arrested after trying to escape the Kruger National Park in possession of a freshly cut set of rhino horns, a hunting rifle and ammunition. SANParks officials, rangers and protection services, as well as members of the South African Police Service, stopped the suspects by using a chopper to prevent their escape. The suspects will appear at the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court on Monday. A SANParks employee was also arrested. The police’s colonel Mtsholi Bhembe says: “As police we are not ruling out the possibility of an inside job. The fact that one of the suspects is an employee makes it a strong possibility.”  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
