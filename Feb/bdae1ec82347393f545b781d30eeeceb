The Department of Energy had announced petrol will go up by 7 cents a litre from Wednesday; but it’s not all bad news, with diesel expected to decrease by 5 cents. CAPE TOWN - Motorists will fork out a little more for petrol from midnight. The Department of Energy had announced petrol will go up by 7 cents a litre from Wednesday; but it’s not all bad news, with diesel expected to decrease by 5 cents. This is the first petrol price increase since December. The Automobile Association (AA)’s Layton Beard said: "The reason we are seeing the price hike tonight is primarily because of an increase in international petroleum prices. There are two factors that influence fuel prices, one is international petrol prices and the other one is the rand/US dollar exchange rate." The AA also says there’s no reason to believe the petrol price hike is the first of many to come this year. "It’s extremely speculative and dangerous to say because you’ve seen the one increase, it means now we are going to be seeing increases in the months ahead. What it does mean is that we need to keep a close eye on both of these factors and see what the numbers tell us on a daily basis, and on an average basis at the end of the month to determine whether there’s going to be an increase,” Beard said.
