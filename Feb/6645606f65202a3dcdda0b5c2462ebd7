The anti-gang unit is investigating the shooting that took place outside the school earlier this morning. CAPE TOWN – A man has been shot and killed while dropping his children at Woodville Primary School in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town. The 37-year-old father was dropping off his child, as well as his brother's two children at the school before 8 am on Wednesday when he was shot dead. The police's Noloyiso Rwexana says: “The man was shot and fatally wounded. No one else was wounded in the vehicle. A case of murder has been opened for investigation, with no arrests at this stage.” The Lentegeur Community Policing Forum's Byron De Villiers says they've arranged trauma counselling for the deceased's wife and children and by no means condone this kind of behaviour. At the same time, the Western Cape Education Department says pupils and teachers are receiving counselling after witnessing the shooting. The department has also requested that police increase visibility in the area while the anti-gang unit investigates. The department's Jessica Shelver said: “A teacher who was on scholar patrol and witnessed the incident is deeply traumatised and our heartfelt condolences go to the learner who lost a father, the rest of the family and the broader school community.” Over the last week, there has been a spate of gang-related shootings in the area.
