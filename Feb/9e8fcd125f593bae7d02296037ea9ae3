This brings the total number of bodies rescued to at least 18. JOHANNESBURG - Police have confirmed that 13 more bodies have been brought to the surface at the Gloria Coal Mine in Mpumalanga on Friday. This brings the total number of bodies rescued to at least 18. More than 10 people died following a gas explosion at one of the abandoned mine shafts earlier this month. The mine, which has been placed under business rescue, believes that at least nine people are still unaccounted for. The police's Leonard Hlathi said: “We have got an inquest docket that we have opened which we continue to add names on it. We might have a remainder of nine names because the five that were taken out three weeks ago are not counted on the 2. Out of the 22, we have got 13 with a remainder of nine.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
