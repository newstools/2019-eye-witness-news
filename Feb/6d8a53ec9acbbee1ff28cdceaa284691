CAPE TOWN - The gangster who shot dead nine-year-old Aqeel Davids in Ocean View has been handed an effective 25-year prison sentence. In September 2017, 25-year-old Dillon Petersen fired nine shots at the Davids' family home that rival gangsters had run into. The boy was hit by a stray bullet while his family was preparing for his grandmother's wedding. The public gallery was packed with relatives and Ocean View residents on Thursday. Petersen was handed a 20-year sentence for murder and 12-year sentences for seven counts of attempted murder; those sentences will run concurrently. He's been handed an additional five years for the possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Outside court, Davidsâ€™s family voiced their dissatisfaction with the sentence, telling the media they had expected a harsher punishment. On the stand last Thursday, he cracked during cross-examination by the State and admitted to having been the gunman who shot at the house. During the shooting, nine-year-old Davids was shot in the head and several other people were wounded.
