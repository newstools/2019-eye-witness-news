The city will be replacing old water pipes with a new pipe system which will be more tolerant of the soil condition. CAPE TOWN - The Knysna Municipality announced that residents will experience water service interruptions, as the upgrading of pipework at the Old Place Pump Station is planned to commence. The upgrades are expected to cost approximately R5 million to the existing water network in the CBD. This project will be rolled-out in phases and the first phase is expected to start the end of February. The old pipes will be replaced with a new pipe system which is more tolerant of the soil condition. This work will address pressure management issues and also reduce the number of pipe breaks in the CBD. Knysna executive Mayor Mark Willemse urged the community of Knysna to look out for updates and more information on their social media pages. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
