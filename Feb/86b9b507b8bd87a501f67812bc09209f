GOOD secretary-general Brett Heron says the party has completed the premier candidate selection process for four of the provinces. CAPE TOWN - Political party, GOOD has today announced that Patricia de Lille  will campaign for the Western Cape premier’s post. De Lille served as Cape Town mayor from 2011 before resigning last year after a protracted legal battle with the Democratic Alliance (DA). She subsequently formed her own party and now serves as its leader. GOOD secretary-general Brett Heron says the party has completed the premier candidate selection process for four of the provinces. “We believe Patricia de Lille offers the voters of the Western Cape the opportunity to elect a premier that has the leadership experience, passion and energy to unite our province.” GOOD this week launched its manifesto, “The Good Plan to Fix South Africa’, which will focus on fighting racism, land expropriation without compensation, unemployment and corruption. The eight-week-old party also named Vivian Law as the North West premier candidate. Law, who’s Good’s Deputy National Organiser, has a background in philanthropy, business and is also a farmer.  The party chose Leonard McKay, who currently resides in the Green Kalahari, as its Northern Cape Candidate.  McKay works as an investigator and case presenter at Eskom. GOOD Deputy Secretary-General Lehlohonolo Mtshali, is the party’s Gauteng premier candidate. He previously served as a Councillor in the Ekurhuleni Metro for six years. Mtshali also assists young businesses to access training and funding from the private sector and government, in his capacity as co-founder of the Township Business Association.  Despite announcing only four candidates, Good says it will contest the elections in all nine provinces.
