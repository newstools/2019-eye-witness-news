Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says those arrested allegedly received and accepted gifts in the form of cash. JOHANNESBURG - Court papers seen by Eyewitness News show that former Bosasa executives Angelo Agrizzi and Andries van Tonder as well as former Correctional Services Commissioner Linda Mti are among the 7 people arrested by the Hawks on allegations of corruption, money laundering and fraud related to the recent Bosasa revelations at the state capture inquiry. The unit says the arrests follow investigations into the misappropriation of R1.6 billion in tenders awarded to the company by the Correctional Services Department and its affiliates. Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi says those arrested allegedly received and accepted gifts in the form of cash. "It's based on the investigation that has been ongoing. We have now taken a decision to bring those fingered in corruption to court today (Wednesday). They are currently being processed and will appear today at the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court." They also allegedly received financial assistance in buying properties, cars, and payments to travel abroad. In their recent testimonies at the state capture inquiry, former Bosasa executives revealed how former high-ranking Correctional Services officials and another government official were on Bosasa’s bankroll in exchange for state business, protection and influence. Mulaudzi adds, “There are three entities that will also be brought in to face the same charges with the individuals. On Wednesday, we’ll be taking them to court.“ WATCH: 'I'll kill you if you tell anyone' - Basson on Bosasa threats  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
