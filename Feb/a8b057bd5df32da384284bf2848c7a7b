PIETERMARITZBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu (70) has fainted while delivering his State of the Province Address. Premier Willies Mchunu was discussing the inroads and progress KwaZulu Natal has made in infrastructure development, when he suddenly paused and then requested that leader of government business Sihle Zikalala take over from him. “Madam Speaker, may I posit here to request the leader of government business to continue on my behalf, I have a challenge.” Moments later, Mchunu lost his balance and was swiftly assisted by officials near the stage as he collapsed. Shock moved through the room as dozens of guests tried to edge closer to the premier, trying to conduct prayers. The KZN premier has not been well for several months, which is part of the reason why Zikalala has been stepping in in an acting capacity during multiple government events. Mchunu has now been attended to by paramedics, who were on scene within minutes of the collapse.
