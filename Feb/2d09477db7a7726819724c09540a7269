The ANC has confirmed that its grievance panel has cleared Pule Mabe of sexual assault allegations lodged by his former personal assistant. JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson Pule Mabe  will be back at work this week. The ANC has confirmed that Mabe has been cleared of sexual assault allegations lodged by his former personal assistant. Last year, Mabe took special leave after the former employee claimed he assaulted her on three different occasions and cut her salary when she spoke out. The ANC now says its grievance panel found there was no evidence supporting her claims. ANC spokesperson Dakota Legoete said: “We are excepting Pule Mabe to be back at work anytime from tomorrow once we have publicly made our position very clear.” The ANC says it's accepted the recommendations of the grievance panel. Legoete says the party will start developing a sexual harassment policy as recommended by the grievance panel. “He has been cleared and the ANC will have to have a sexual harassment policy within the next three months.” He says because Mabe’s former PA alleged that the ANC spokesperson visited her hotel room late at night and sat on her bed, the party will now ensure the privacy of staff and manager’s bedrooms will be respected. “The lines should be drawn properly in terms of mutuality and relationships at the workplace.” Mabe is expected back at work as soon as Tuesday. The ANC also says the 26-year-old former PA can report for duty and will likely be moved to another department.
