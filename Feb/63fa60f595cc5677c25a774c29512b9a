Hofmeyr made the submission at the Mokgoro inquiry which is sitting in centurion on Monday. PRETORIA - Deputy prosecutions boss Willie Hofmeyr  says that prosecutors do sometimes get things wrong, but it depends on the circumstances to determine whether they’re still fit and proper to remain in office. Hofmeyr made the submission at the Mokgoro Inquiry  which is sitting in Centurion on Monday. Retired Justice Yvonne Mokgoro is investigating advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi’s fitness to hold office. Hofmeyr conceded to Jiba’s counsel, Advocate Norman Arendse, that he got it wrong when it came to the decision to withdraw charges against former President Jacob Zuma. “When prosecutors get it badly wrong from time to time, does that manifest that they are not fit and proper to serve in that position?” Hofmeyr told the commission that the circumstances in each individual case matter. He then referred to allegations he’s made against Jiba. “But I also think that there’s a difference between a decision like that to not prosecute and a decision to prosecute somebody where there’s very little evidence.” Hofmeyr rejected claims that the Zuma decision was a political one.
