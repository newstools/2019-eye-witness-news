CAPE TOWN - Wife killer Jason Rohde will be sentenced in a week's time following the completion of closing arguments on Wednesday. Last year, the property mogul was convicted of killing Susan Rohde at the Spier Wine Estate in 2016 and trying to stage her suicide. The State has called on the court to impose a punishment exceeding the minimum prescribed sentence of 15 years. The defence argues there's no basis for a harsher punishment. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe says Susan didn't die instantly and suffered a painful and gruesome death. Defence advocate Graham van Der Spuy has urged the court to consider his client does not have a history of showcasing violent or aggressive behaviour, having been described by friends and his mother as avoiding conflict and confrontation. Van der Spuy has also labelled the victim's death a crime of passion. He adds he can only describe his client's actions as a moment of weakness in which he snapped. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
