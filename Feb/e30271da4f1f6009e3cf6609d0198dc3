A committee vote on Tuesday went six against three in favour of the decision against any inquiry into Busisiwe Mkhwebane. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) does not accept the decision by Parliament’s justice committee not to fast-track an inquiry into the Public Protector’s Busisiwe Mkhwebane fitness to hold office. A committee vote on Tuesday went six against three in favour of the decision against any inquiry into Mkhwebane. DA MPs slammed the committee’s report on the matter, while the African Christian Democratic Party also objected. But a majority vote by African National Congress MPs, with the surprise support of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), carried the day. Parliament’s justice committee has decided it would be premature to hold any inquiry into her fitness to hold office as her challenge of the Constitutional Court’s order that she personally pay part of the costs of the Absa-CIEX  matter must still be dealt with. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen asked for the investigation last February following a number of adverse court findings against Mkhwebane. DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach said: “This report does not begin to reflect the deliberations that took place in the committee, it’s nothing short of a disgrace.” Breytenbach says the party will compile a minority report. EFF’S APPARENT FLIP-FLOP The EFF has changed their tune on the Public Protector, saying she should remain in office. The party in 2018 said Mkhwebane should do the right thing and step down after she conceded she was wrong in directing that the constitutional mandate of the Reserve Bank be changed. EFF MP Thilivhali Mulaudzi explained the party’s apparent flip-flop: “The English proverb says, ‘A wise man changes his mind’ because in an earlier position we thought she was going to be an ANC stooge, but after seeing her performance and work we were convinced that she’s the right person for the job.” (Edited by Thapelo Lekabe)
