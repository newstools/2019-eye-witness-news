Wallabies hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau has joined the squad for the first time this year after spending the season with Leicester Tigers in England. CAPE TOWN - The Wallabies hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau believed the team would get back to winning ways in their second match of the Rugby Championship against Argentina this weekend in Brisbane, Australia. Wallabies opened their season with a loss over the Springboks in Ellis Park last week. Polota-Nau has joined the squad for the first time this year after spending the season with Leicester Tigers in England. "It's great to be back in the team -  all the boys have welcomed me with open arms. Against South Africa, we didn't do well - there's a lot of confidence amongst the boys and hopefully, we will pick up on our good form against Argentina this weekend. And of course in terms of the hooking spot, there's a lot of competition but we all want what's best for the team." Polota-Nau was the only hooker in the Australia camp with any World Cup experience but knew he has work to do to secure a spot in the squad for Japan. "There's a lot of contestants there which is great for the team, I know that will bring out the best in me," he said.
