ANC leader in the provincial legislature Cameron Dugmore said the army was not the solution to curbing crime. CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape said the provincial government had run out of ideas on how to tackle crime. ANC leader in the provincial legislature Cameron Dugmore said the army was not the solution to curbing crime. * SANDF deployment to gang-hit CT areas could escalate violence His comments came after Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz called for the army to manage a state of emergency in the province. However, Dugmore said deploying the SANDF was not the answer. “Our communities need active support, like more visible policing. We need a stronger presence of the Anti-Gang Unit and special task teams in all affected communities. The call by MEC Fritz is misguided.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
