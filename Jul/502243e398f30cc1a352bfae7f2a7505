Community members and alleged land invaders faced off on Friday over the occupation of land. Maile said he was confident a solution can be found. “The nature of the problems require us to put systems in place and have structures to resolve those problems.” The MEC said he would also call on Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba to meet with residents.
