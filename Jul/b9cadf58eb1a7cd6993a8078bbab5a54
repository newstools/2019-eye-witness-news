Sadly guys, Iâ€™ve had a minor setback on my road to recovery. Iâ€™ve been pushing myself abit too hard in training so that I can make a memorable comeback but I have picked up a bone bruise on my knee so wonâ€™t be participating in the upcoming @Diamond_League events. ðŸ˜” pic.twitter.com/CY2NXQGkyy  The Olympic gold medalist suffered a freak knee injury during a celebrity touch rugby match in 2017. He made a brief return to the track in February this year, winning the provincial Free State championships in Bloemfontein in a time of 47:28 seconds. Van Niekerk, though, was not at 100% during that race and continued his rehabilitation. "He had MRI scans which showed the ligaments and meniscus in his right knee were fine, but unfortunately he picked up a bone bruise which has set him back five or six weeks", said Peet van Zyl of In-Site Athlete Management. Van Niekerk, who successfully defended his 400m title and earned a silver in the 200m at the IAAF World Championships two years ago, could compete in Doha later in the season, having received a wild card entry as the defending 400m champion. "It's very disappointing as I probably pushed myself too hard but I'm now working towards the goal patiently and I will review my competition schedule with my team and together with my coach (Ans Botha) will decide where and when to race", said Van Niekerk.
