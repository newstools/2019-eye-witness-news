CAPE TOWN - The Stellenbosch Magistrates Court on Monday ruled against singer Steve Hofmeyr in an apartheid flag case. Activist Johan Pienaar exhibited a protest installation during the Woordfees in Stellenbosch called  Laying Down the Flag last year. It featured the old South African flag with the names of people Pienaar claims were architects and enablers of apartheid. Hofmeyr and Freedom Front Plus MP Corné Mulder’s names were included in the flag displayed by Pienaar. Pienaar invited people to walk over the flag.

The court has now issued a final interdict which has ordered Hofmeyr to cease and desist from this type of behaviour. Pienaar emphasised the important role of art in addressing social issues, even if it led to discomfort. “It’s a complete vindication of the points we raised in our original application before the courts and amounts to the condemnation of Mr Hofmeyr’s actions in this regard. The magistrate agreed that it was harassment and that the said harassment caused harm to me.” The court also ordered Hofmeyr to tweet that the bounty he placed on the flag's removal was rescinded. I hereby withdraw any reward I previously made to anybody who would steal or remove the contextualised South African flag belonging to Johan Pienaar.
