PRETORIA - Businessman Dr Reuel Khoza has been appointed interim CEO of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) board. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni  made the announcement at the pension fund manager’s headquarters in Pretoria on Thursday. The PIC board has elected Khoza as chair of the state-owned asset manager and Sindi Mabaso-Koyana as his deputy. Khoza joined the PIC after having served on the boards of Eskom, Nedbank, and Assupol. He said his first mandate would be to restore stability to the corporation. “And we will also strive in making sure that we actually restore the PIC its glory of the heydays when the PIC was actually held in high esteem,” Khoza said. Khoza said another one of his priorities would be to fill other crucial positions. He joined the R2 trillion government pension fund manager while its procurement processes have been scrutinised and its former leadership, including former CEO Dan Matjila, had been called to answer at the PIC inquiry.
