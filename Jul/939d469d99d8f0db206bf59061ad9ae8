A commotion broke out when EFF MPs disrupted Pravin Gordhan saying he should not be allowed to address MPs as he is a 'constitutional delinquent' JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members of Parliament were kicked out of Minister Pravin Gordhan's Public Enterprises budget vote in Parliament by security officials on Thursday afternoon. A commotion broke out when EFF MPs disrupted Gordhan saying he should not be allowed to address MPs as he is a 'constitutional delinquent'. "We see no need to be addressed by a constitutional delinquent and we cannot listen to him," one of the EFF MPs said. The point of order was refused and Gordhan was asked to continue with his speech. However, the EFF refused to back down and continued rising on the same point of order. The situation escalated when they left their seats to confront Gordhan at the podium where he was standing, pointing fingers at him. Security was then asked to escort them out, after which a scuffle broke out. Gordhan reacted saying: "They must touch me." Earlier this week, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that Gordhan violated the Constitution when allowing a so-called South African Revenue Service (Sars) "rogue" unit to operate during his tenure as the tax agencyâ€™s commissioner.
