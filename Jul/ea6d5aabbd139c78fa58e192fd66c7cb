A video was posted on social media showing Tshepiso Shongwe in the driver's seat of a Toyota taxi in peak hour traffic in Joburg. JOHANNESBURG - Wednesday started out as a normal day for Tshepiso Shongwe, but by the end of the morning, she'd become an emergency taxi driver during her daily commute to work. A video was posted on social media showing Shongwe in the driver's seat of a Toyota taxi in peak hour traffic in Joburg. Witnesses say the taxi's driver got into an altercation with a Johannesburg Metro Police officer at Faraday taxi rank in the city centre. The officer eventually pepper-sprayed the driver, leaving him in agony. Shongwe then had to step in and make sure the passengers arrived at their destination, a few kilometres away.  Speaking to Nickolaus Bauer on 702's Afternoon Drive, she explained what happened. "Never had I thought that I would be driving a taxi this morning. "I had to drive all the way because he could not see properly, so we had to drive all the way inside MTN [rank]. "After they sprayed him, they gave him a ticket and left him like that. He asked: 'Is there anybody who can drive this taxi to Noord? My eyes are burning I can't see.'"
