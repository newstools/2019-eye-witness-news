CAPE TOWN - Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said a dedicated team was working to ensure the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) met its bailout requirements. The Communications Department was working with National Treasury to see whether the public broadcaster, which was facing major financial woes, could be granted a bailout. The SABC, however, needed to adhere to specific requirements before the bailout could be granted. Addressing Parliament's communications portfolio committee earlier on Wednesday, Ndabeni-Abrahams stressed the importance of granting the SABC the bailout. "We have delegated certain people from the department to make sure that they interact with the SABC on a weekly basis to say 'this is what is required', including the certain conditions Treasury must meet." She elaborated on the role of the broadcaster in the country: "SABC has to be bailed out, as I said, for the interest of the public and not of the shareholders and executive board so that the mandate of informing, educating and entertaining the people of South Africa is realised."
