At 0645 GMT, the rand was 0.35% weaker at R14.2300 per dollar, extending losses from Friday that saw the currency tumble to its weakest in seven sessions after the US nonfarm payrolls data. On Monday morning, the greenback measured against a basket of major currencies had climbed to its best since 19 June, snapping a rally by the rand and other emerging market currencies.

Iran said on Sunday it will shortly boost its uranium enrichment above a cap set by a landmark 2015 nuclear deal, prompting a warning ‘to be careful’ from US President Donald Trump, who has pressured Tehran to renegotiate the pact.
