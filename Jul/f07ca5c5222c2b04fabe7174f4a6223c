Premier Alan Winde delivered his state of the province address on Thursday, saying government will invest billions more into housing. CAPE TOWN - Premier Alan Winde said the provincial government has over the past 10 years delivered more than 700,000 housing opportunities. Winde delivered his state of the province address on Thursday, saying government would invest billions more into housing, which would be coupled with improved service delivery. The provincial government might have delivered more than half a million housing opportunities, but the housing backlog continued to grow. More than 600,000 households were still in need. Winde said there has been progress but said the focus was now on creating a better living environment. “No matter where you live and where you work, your life will be made easier. One of the key and tangible opportunities is in creating spaces where people can live and prosper.” The premier said all housing developments would go hand-in-hand with transport infrastructure. He said communities would no longer be established far from transport nodes. AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE PRIORITISED Winde said agriculture would play a pivotal role in education over the next five years. At the heart of this move was Winde's plan to ensure food security and create jobs. Winde said agriculture was a big part of the Western Cape’s economy and similarly, agricultural education needed to be promoted. “And I am not talking about how to milk a cow. I’m talking about how to programme a robot.” He also said new talent was needed in the sector to transform and revitalise it.
