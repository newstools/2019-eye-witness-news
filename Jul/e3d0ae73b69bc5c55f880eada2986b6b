LONDON â€“ British cyclist Mark Cavendish will miss the Tour de France for the first time since 2007 after being left out of this year's eight-man Dimension Date team on Tuesday. The 34-year-old sprinter, who has won 30 stages on the Tour de France, has struggled for form since returning to action this year after a second bout of the debilitating Epstein Barr virus. He has only made the podium once in 2019 - third place in the third stage of the Tour of Turkey in April - and could only finish 22nd in the British National Championships road race on Sunday. Cavendish is just four stage wins shy of Eddy Merckx's record of 34.
