On Tuesday, the High Court in Johannesburg ruled the dismissal was unlawful and ordered that he be temporarily reinstated. JOHANNESBURG - The lawyer for Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo said just because the insurer was appealing his reinstatement, it didn’t mean he couldn’t continue to work. Moyo has returned to the company's headquarters on Wednesday despite warnings that he should not. Old mutual had fired him for what it said was a conflict of interest regarding payments to NMT Capital, a company he co-founded. But on Tuesday, the High Court in Johannesburg ruled the dismissal was unlawful and ordered that he be temporarily reinstated. Moyo’s lawyer Eric Mabuza said: “Their legal position is incorrect; the correct position is that the interim order is not suspended by the application for leave to appeal. If you want to suspend an interim order, you need to go to court.” Speaking for the first time since his win against the insurance giant, he said he loved working for Old Mutual and has nothing against the company itself. Moyo has described the insurance provider as a good company, saying the actions of individuals should be separated from the company itself. “You actually have to separate the character of the company; the company has got very good people. Like I’ve been saying, I believe in this company, I’m the biggest customer of this company and it is very good.” Meanwhile, Mabuza said the seriousness of the talks with Old Mutual needed their senior counsel to be present. He said their senior council Advocate Dali Mpofo would be joining the meeting on Wednesday afternoon. “We will continue talking but we’re waiting for their senior counsel to talk about what is happening.” But the company's lawyers said it is the law that if they challenge a court ruling, he could not be reinstated until the matter was finalised. The company's lawyers have since said they would not be available on Wednesday.
