The son of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in a crash with a taxi on Johannesburgâ€™s M1 in 2014, killing passenger Phumzile Dube. RANDBURG - Duduzane Zuma has been acquitted of culpable homicide and reckless driving charges in the Randburg Magistrates Court, concluding the case that has spanned five years. Magistrate Tebogo Thupatlase said that the State failed to prove that Zuma had acted in any way that resulted in his Porsche veering towards a minibus taxi during a 2014 fatal crash on the M1 highway.   Passenger Phumzile Dube died on impact. Duduzane Zuma, his father former President Jacob Zuma and other family members heaved sighs of relief when the magistrate pronounced he was not guilty of culpable homicide and the other charges. Thupatlase said the State failed to prove the case against Zuma beyond reasonable doubt. He discredited most of the evidence and testimonies presented by State prosecutors who said that Zuma was driving negligently on the night of the crash. While Duduzane declined to comment, his father told the media shortly after the judgment was handed down that he was relieved that the matter was over.
