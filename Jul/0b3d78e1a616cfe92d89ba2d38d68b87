JOHANNESBURG - The rand treaded water in early trade on Tuesday in the absence of local economic drivers as investors await the monetary policy committee meeting later this week and ex-president Jacob Zuma’s testimony at a graft inquiry. At 0647 GMT, the rand ticked up 0.09% at R13.8900 per dollar from its close of R13.9025 in New York. “With this commission that is going on, it is a welcome distraction in terms of a very lethargic market,” said Oliver Alwar, senior trader at Standard Bank. Riskier assets continue to benefit from expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut, he added. The rand is expected to trade in a range of R13.80 to R14.05 to the dollar on Tuesday, NKC African Economics said in a note. The yield on South Africa’s benchmark 2026 government bond dipped 2 basis points to 8.020%. By 0733 GMT, stocks were higher with the benchmark JSE Top-40 Index up 0.2% to 51,553 points while the broader All-Share Index ticked up 0.13% to 57,612 points.
