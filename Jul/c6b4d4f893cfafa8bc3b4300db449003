We have also informed Sassa around the humanitarian relief.” Smith said blockages in the stormwater system has emerged as a big concern at Wednesday’s winter task team meeting. He said the blockages were caused by illegal dumping and the storing of items in the drains.

Besides flooding, authorities have been dealing with power outages, fallen trees or structural damage.
