CAPE TOWN - The Sharks have named veteran Springboks winger JP Pietersen to the starting XV to face the Griquas on Friday. Newly appointed Currie Cup head coach Sean Everitt also named several youngsters on the bench. The Sharks team showed some strong continuity for the opening round clash of the 2019 Currie Cup competition. Ten players for Friday evening’s starting line-up were selected in the Super Rugby quarter-final match against the Brumbies with a total of 13 from the matchday 23 which allowed for continuity. Pietersen would start alongside co-captain Jeremy Ward at the outside centre while Craig Burden played off the bench as the replacement hooker. Ward’s co-captain Tera Mtembu was part of a quality pack that would no doubt be tested against the tough Griquas’ forwards who would relish the opportunity to have a go at their Durban counterparts.
