I’m actually going home now as this has cost me day's work.” Logan Reddy stays in Lenasia South and accused the authorities of turning a blind eye to land invasions. "Land invasions are getting out of hand at the moment. We are surrounded by informal settlements, this is not stopping and is causing havoc. The crime rate has gone up, infrastructure can't keep up. How do we live in this area when it is government that is causing this havoc." The Joburg Metro Police's Xolani Fihla said officers have been deployed to monitor the protests. "Zakariyya Park is in total shutdown; roads are closed with burning tyres and bricks. There about 70 community members closing off the road; so, motorists are advised to avoid the road and use alternative roads."
