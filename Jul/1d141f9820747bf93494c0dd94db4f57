The MEC said housing would always remain a big issue because the province received over 200,000 people a year. But, he said, they would ensure that there's equitable allocation of houses to help bring down service delivery protests linked to housing. “People who don’t qualify are getting houses, we will definitely clamp on that and the corruption in the allocation of houses so that the projects we have are done on time.”
