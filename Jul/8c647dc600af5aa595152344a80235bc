PARKTOWN - Dozens of former President Jacob Zuma's supporters have gathered at a park nearby the state capture commission venue in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Monday. They're wearing African National Congress t-shirts bearing the former presidents face. They're singing struggle songs while police keep an eye on them. They were present as part of a gathering organised by the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association, which believed Zuma was innocent and was being vilified by the commission. Zuma was expected to address them later on Monday. #StateCaptureInquiry MK vets and supporters in ANC regalia.
