The Constitutional Court has dismissed Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s appeal against a personal costs order. JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court has upheld the High Court order that Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane personally pay for 15% of the South African Reserve Bank’s legal fees in the Bankorp lifeboat matter. In 2017, the Public Protector ordered the Special Investigating Unit to recover more than R1 billion on behalf of the central bank from Absa Bank but this report and its remedial action was reviewed and set aside last year.  The High Court ruling, which has been confirmed by the apex court, said that Mkhwebane conducted herself in bad faith and submitted numerous falsehoods to the court. In the scathing majority judgment, Justice Sisi Khampepe said that Mkhwebane’s conduct warranted the personal costs order against her. Khampepe said that Mkhwebane misled the court. The minority judgment, however, found in favour of the Public Protector and would have granted her the appeal.
