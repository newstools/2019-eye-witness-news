Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament in relation to the R500,000 Bosasa donation. PRETORIA - The Public Protector has found that President Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament in relation to a R500,000 donation to his African National Congress (ANC) election campaign fund. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane released the findings of her report at a briefing in Pretoria on Friday. In November 2018, Ramaphosa responded to a question in which he claimed that the money was in fact payment to his son for services but he later corrected. Mkhwebane has not only found that President Cyril Ramaphosa misled Parliament but that he also improperly exposed himself to a situation involving a conflict of interest. She also found that there was an improper relationship between the president and his family and African Global Operations - formerly known as Bosasa. Mkhwebane found that the manner in which the R500,000 donation was channeled through several accounts before being paid into the presidentâ€™s campaign account raised suspicion of money laundering. She has referred this aspect to the authorities for further investigation. The Public Protector has ordered the National Assembly Speaker to demand that Ramaphosa disclose all donations received for his campaign.
