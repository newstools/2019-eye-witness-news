HARARE - President Emmerson Mnangagwa  has held talks with President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the two discussed Zimbabwe's growing power crisis. Zimbabwe has been experiencing daily power cuts of around 18 hours due to reduced generating capacity, and the state power company said it needed $14 million a month to import power from regional suppliers. Confirming the meeting with his South African counterpart, Mnangagwa tweeted that Zimbabwe and South Africa were part of the same family.  At their meeting on the sidelines of an AU summit in Niger, the two presidents were understood to have discussed various issues, including Zimbabwe’s power crisis. Mnangagwa told state media that Zimbabwe’s power company, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, still owed Eskom a lot of money. But he said after last week’s payment of $10 million to Eskom, Zimbabwe’s energy minister was to lead a delegation to South Africa to try to clinch a new power supply deal.
