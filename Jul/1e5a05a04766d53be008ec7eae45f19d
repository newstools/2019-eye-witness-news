Mabuza would assume the duty as Acting Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) for Eskom due to the resignation of Phakamani Hadebe, who would leave Eskom on 31 July 2019. JOHANNESBURG – Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday released a statement announcing Jabu Mabuza’s appointment as the acting executive chairman for Eskom and acting CEO of Eskom Holdings. Mabuza would assume the duty as Acting Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) for Eskom due to the resignation of Phakamani Hadebe, who would leave Eskom on 31 July 2019. Public enterprises spokesperson Adrian Lackay said after the resignation of Hadebe, a number of names were considered internally to act as group CEO. “Consideration was given to a number of names but it was felt that at the end of the day that as the shareholder minister exercising his discretion, Mr Mabuza is best-placed to conduct this on an interim basis.” He said Mabuza was set to occupy the position for just three months. “The board has taken on that task of just a three months period to find a suitable group CEO for Eskom Holdings.” Lackay said there was an urgency on both the part of the public enterprises minister and President Cyril Ramaphosa to find a suitable group CEO for the parastatal.
