The unlikely duo met at a nail salon in Detroit to film a campaign video aimed at younger voters - a fitting spot for Cardi B, who is known for her elaborate manicures in addition to chart-topping hits. "We (are) working on a way to involve more young people in the political process," Sanders, 77, told CNN before filming began. "They are voting in large numbers, but not enough numbers." Democratic polling shows Sanders is the number two candidate in a crowded field seeking the party's nomination to defeat Donald Trump, although Sanders has about half the support of the leader Joe Biden. After the shoot, Cardi B posted a picture on Instagram of her interviewing the Vermont senator in the salon. "Thank you Senator Bernie Sanders for sitting with me and sharing your plans on how you will change this country," the Grammy-winning artist captioned the image. Not me, US. Thank you Senator Bernie Sanders for sitting with me and sharing your plans on how you will change this country.

I got a lot of submission and selected the most popular questions to get answered. Stay tuned to see how he will fight for economic, racial, and social justice for all. Together, letâ€™s build a movement of young people to transform this country.LETS LEARN OUR CANDIDATES!
