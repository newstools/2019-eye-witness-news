Players including Siya Kolisi, Victor Matfield and James Dalton paid tribute to Small at his memorial service on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG – Former Springbok rugby wing, James Small, has been described by players, past and present, as an icon of the game. Players including Siya Kolisi, Victor Matfield and James Dalton paid tribute to Small at his memorial service on Thursday. Small died of a heart attack at the age of 50 last week. There was a sombre mood at the Wanderers Rugby Club as hundreds of people gathered to remember Small. World Cup-winning teammate, Dalton, described Small as Bok player through and through “He was a teammate through and through. We were a team and he lived for the Springbok emblem and its ethos.” Captain Siya Kolisi said the class of '95 was a huge inspiration. “I think that gave us the belief and hope that us as a country when we come together we can make anything happen and he was a huge part of that.” Small played 47 tests over five years and will be remembered for his performance against All Black Jonah Lomu in the 1995 Rugby World Cup final.
