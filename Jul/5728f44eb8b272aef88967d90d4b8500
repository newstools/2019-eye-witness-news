The Independent Electoral Commission has ruled in favour of the Freedom Front Plus and deregistered Andile Mngxitama's party as an official political party. JOHANNESBURG - Black First Land First (BLF) said they would take their fight against the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) deregistering them as a political party to the Constitutional Court if they have to. The commission has ruled in favour of the Freedom Front Plus and deregistered Andile Mngxitama's party as an official political party. The IEC said this was based on the party's section of their constitution that it was only open to blacks people. But the party's deputy president Zanele Lwana said this was an attack on them. “No racist organisation is going to pressure the commission to deregister us. We will appeal this decision and we will do all that is within our power to ensure we continue to exist as an organisation.” FF Plus party leader Pieter Groenewald welcomed the commission’s decision. “We said that they were contravening Section 16 of the Electoral Commission Act because their membership is based on race.”
