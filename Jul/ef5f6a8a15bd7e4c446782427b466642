JOHANNESBURG - The rand strengthened on Thursday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve set the stage for a US interest rate cut later this month, weakening the dollar and boosting risk appetite worldwide. At 0657 GMT, the rand traded at R13.9350 versus the dollar, up 0.3% from its previous close. The yield on South Africa’s benchmark 2026 government bond dropped eight basis points to 8.030%, reflecting higher bond prices.
