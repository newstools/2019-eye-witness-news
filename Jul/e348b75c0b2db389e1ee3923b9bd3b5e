"The survivors in our shelters are not receiving the kind of adequate assistance that they need, often resulting in the fact that even staff don't receive minimum standard salaries." Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu on Tuesday received and signed a memorandum of the protesterâ€™s demands. "We are almost in the month of August, which for me is the most painful month because why do we say that we are celebrating it? The biggest challenge is about what is happening to the most vulnerable of the women and you are here representing them and I appreciate that very much."
