CAPE TOWN - More than 30 firefighters are battling a fire after a gas tanker exploded in Worcester's industrial area. The Breede Valley Municipality said that the gas tanker went up in flames early on Wednesday morning. The fire spread to a nearby building. A local explains what he saw: "There were four loud bangs...the dogs were going off but with each bang, the garage door was rattling. We all went outside to see what was going on. It actually looked like Chernobyl, the flame was so big... on our neighbour's walls, you could see the light." The explosion led to a number of road closures. No injuries have been reported. Breede River Valley fire chief Theo Botha: "Fortunately, the incident occurred in an industrial area, so the factories were closed and there was no one in the vicinity, so that helped save lives."
