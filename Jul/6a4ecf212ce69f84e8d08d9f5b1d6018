Zuma addressed the new threats on Tuesday morning before continuing with his testimony. He told the commission his PA got a call on Monday night to say: “Tell Zuma we are doing to kill him, his children, and people around him". He said his senior counsel was also threatened. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said the alleged threats on Zuma’s life and that of his counsel were unacceptable. But he conceded to Zuma that while the commission would investigate and assist him following the claim, he was uncertain whether Zuma did not already have maximum protection by virtue of being a former head of state. "Ordinarily with regards to other witnesses, I would urge the commission to take necessary steps to make sure a witness who's giving evidence in the commission gets all the protection they can give. What I don't know is whether you don't already have maximum protection. I don't know if there's anything beyond the protection you get." Zuma alleged that even the lives of his children and the families of his lawyers were threatened during the mysterious phone call to his assistant at Luthuli House.
