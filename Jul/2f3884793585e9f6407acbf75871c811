JOHANNESBURG - South Africans have been paying tribute to legendary South African singer Johnny Clegg. Clegg died at his family home on Tuesday at the age of 66 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015. • From the archives: Johnny Clegg’s ‘final journey’ South Africans took to social media to pay homage to the legendary musician’s tremendous influence on music and social cohesion in the country. Clegg, who was a singer-songwriter, dancer and anthropologist, was praised by a number of local and international bodies for his contribution to music and society. He was known for crossing the racial divide in a time when the country was battling apartheid. Talking to 702 just before his Final Journey tour, he spoke about bridging that divide. “Politics found me, I was not the guy who was walking down the road, saw a fence and said ‘why is there a fence in the road?’ I asked a different question, I asked ‘oh there’s a fence in the road, where are the holes?” The singer and songwriter said his musical destiny was inevitable. Clegg was also an anthropologist, academic, activist and French Knight and became a member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. He was known for his songs with Juluka and Savuka and also teaming up with his son Jessie Clegg. South Africans are mourning the loss of a music giant.
