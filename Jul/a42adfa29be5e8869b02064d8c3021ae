The French club signed Herrera, who joined United from Athletic Bilbao in 2014, on a five-year deal after the Spanish midfielder ran down his contract. PARIS – Ander Herrera says his decision to leave Manchester United for Paris St Germain was triggered by a lack of urgency from the club in contract negotiations as well as questions over his role in the side. The French club signed Herrera, who joined United from Athletic Bilbao in 2014, on a five-year deal after the Spanish midfielder ran down his contract. "I do not like looking at the past very much, but there were differences regarding the project and my importance within it," Herrera told here Spanish newspaper Marca. “I was very happy, I have a lot to thank the club and the fans for it and also to Solskjaer. He did a lot for me to stay, but things did not happen, they arrived late, and by then I had already made the decision to play in Paris...” Herrera made 189 appearances for United and scored 20 goals, winning the FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League in his time at the club.
