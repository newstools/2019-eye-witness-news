Petrol has dropped by 96 cents a litre while diesel now costs up to 75 cents less. JOHANNESBURG â€“ A little relief for cash strapped consumers with the price of fuel going down substantially at midnight. Petrol has dropped by 96 cents a litre while diesel now costs up to 75 cents less. Illuminating paraffin has also come down by 57 cents a litre. Fuel prices have recorded a steady increase since January but finally, there's some respite for motorists. It's a relief for many consumers who already have to contend with rising costs. Economist Sanisha Packrisamy said that the latest fuel adjustments will be welcomed. "This month you'd be paying R680 worth of petrol, whereas a month ago, you'd be paying around R40 more. So that R40 can now be used by consumers either to facilitate other forms of spending on goods and services that they may need." It's still too early to tell what will happen next month as prices will be determined by a number of factors including the rand-dollar exchange rate and crude oil prices.
