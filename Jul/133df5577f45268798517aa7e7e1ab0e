Despite the military being deployed to crime-stricken communities, Fritz said addressing other social ills must also be prioritised. CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz called for greater integration between the South African Police Service (SAPS) and other crime-fighting bodies. Fritz said this would assist in preventing crime from cropping up in other areas. He said anti-crime blitzes could lead to criminal networks moving their operations to other neighbourhoods. Despite the military being deployed to crime-stricken communities, Fritz said addressing other social ills must also be prioritised. “What we have asked also is for a proper lockdown of areas; wipeout every gun that you find. Find the guilty ones and arrest them and put them away in prison,” he said. CRIME DISPLACEMENT POSE A MAJOR THREAT TO CRIME PREVENTION The Western Cape Community Safety Department said what it called crime displacement posed a major obstacle to crime-prevention efforts. Department officials quoted criminologists who explained there were six types of crime displacement. These include targeted displacement, where criminals select new targets as well as spatial displacement where criminals move to new locations to commit crime. Fritz said each of these forms of displacement was a risk to the current crime-busting operations on the ground. "...What we have been asking also, is that the police and the army do proper lockdowns of the area...wipe out every gun that you find...get the gun...find the guilty ones, because the community know exactly who the guilty ones are...arrest them and put them in prison..." Fritz said addressing the eradication of social ills, such as reducing poverty, should be a key focus as part of crime-fighting.
