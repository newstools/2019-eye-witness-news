That gave the left-arm quick his 27th wicket of the 2019 tournament, breaking the record of 26 for a single edition he had previously shared with retired Australia paceman Glenn McGrath. BIRMINGHAM - Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc set a new record for most wickets at a single World Cup when he had England's Jonny Bairstow lbw in the semi-finals at Edgbaston on Thursday. That gave the left-arm quick his 27th wicket of the 2019 tournament, breaking the record of 26 for a single edition he had previously shared with retired Australia paceman Glenn McGrath. But barring a spectacular collapse, Starc's strike looked like being a footnote in the match with England 124 for one in the 18th over chasing a victory target of 224.
