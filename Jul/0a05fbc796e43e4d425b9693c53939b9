Eleven people were killed in shootings at a local tavern last weekend. CAPE TOWN - Residents in Nondwala Street in Philippi said they were living in fear following a shooting at a local tavern. Eleven people were killed in the attack. The motive for the massacre remains unknown at this stage and is still being investigated by police. The sister of a man killed in last weekend's shooting was visibly distraught. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for her safety, said that living opposite the murder scene was a constant reminder of how brutally her brother was taken from their family. "It's very sad because it is painful when your family is not even sick [sic]." She, along with other residents, woke up on Friday morning to blue lights and police officers who carried out stop-and-searches. The woman believed that deploying the army to Philippi would help make the neighbourhood safer. #Philippi Vehicles are being pulled over and searched. Drivers and passengers are being patted down.
