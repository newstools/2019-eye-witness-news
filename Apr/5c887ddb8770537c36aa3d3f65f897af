CAPE TOWN - Nine officials from the Small Business Development Department have been suspended. Minister Lindiwe Zulu placed the employees on suspension for their alleged involvement in corruption and fraud. The department's parliamentary oversight committee said that during oversight visits between 2014 and 2017 to KwaZulu-Natal, MPs found that department grants meant for small, medium and micro-enterprises, as well as cooperatives, weren't being used properly. The visits included the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. A forensic probe was then launched by the Auditor-General's office.
