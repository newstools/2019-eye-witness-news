DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said their hard work was paying off. CAPE TOWN – The Democratic Alliance (DA) has won three by-elections in the Western Cape, including one in Hessequa, previously held by the African National Congress (ANC). The DA also retained wards in Stellenbosch and George; seeing a 23% increase in votes in the Hessequa by-election. In the 2016 local government elections, the party managed to get 34% of the vote. DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said their hard work was paying off. “We have taken away ward 4 from the ANC in Hessequa, the DA is now the majority party in that municipality." ANC spokesperson Dennis Cruywagen said they had learned valuable lessons in the by-elections. "We learned quite a few valuable lessons and one of them is that we must get our voters out to polls stations." In Stellenbosch, the DA retained Ward 9 with a 98% majority vote and in George, retained Ward 18 with 74% of the vote.
