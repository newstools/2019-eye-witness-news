He announced Sars collected about R1.28 trillion for the 2018/2019 year missing its target by almost R15 billion. JOHANNESBURG - Outgoing acting Sars commissioner Mark Kingon says South Africans cannot ignore the effects load shedding has had on businesses. He announced Sars collected about R1.28 trillion for the 2018/2019 year missing its target by almost R15 billion. Company income tax (CIT) accounted for 16.7% of that figure but collections in that category contracted by 2.5% from last financial year. Kingon says instability on the power front and an increase in refunds have had a material effect on collection. “We look at CIT’s specifically and look at the top 30 companies in a large business space, we had an over R11 billion drop in that space specifically.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
