Eskom board chairperson Jabu Mabuza and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan briefed the media on the country’s precarious power supply. JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has presented an overview of the country's electricity status and what needs to be done to address the crisis. Gordhan and some Eskom  executives held a briefing at an Eskom power station outside Johannesburg. He said since his previous briefing to the nation last month, there's a better understanding of the electricity supply situation as well as what needs to be done to resolve it. Gordhan also stressed that for Eskom to get back on track, discipline would be required. “An important culture change needs to happen within Eskom where increased levels of accountability and consequence management are going to be key. In other words, if you promise that X will be done in Y time and if it’s not done in that particular time frame and it impacts negatively on the energy supply, then there must be consequences for the people involved.” Last month, Eskom said the country's power crunch was largely due to a lack of maintenance of the utility's ageing infrastructure. It acknowledged this after implementing rotational power cuts which involved suppressing up to 4,000 megawatts of demand at a given time to avoid overwhelming the national power grid. The country has been in the clear with no power cuts for over a week now after a stretch of stage 4 load shedding in March. Eskom has several plants over 35 years old which have struggled to generate enough power supply to meet demand, a crisis likely to hurt economic growth. WATCH: Mabuza and Gordhan media briefing
