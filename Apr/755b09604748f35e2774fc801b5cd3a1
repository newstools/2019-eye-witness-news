The 36-year-old is allegedly linked to the capturing of applications onto the National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS). CAPE TOWN - The Hawks have arrested a woman for allegedly issuing fraudulent roadworthy certificates in Jeffreys Bay. The 36-year-old is allegedly linked to the capturing of applications onto the National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS). These applications, for Western Cape vehicles, were allegedly issued with roadworthy certificates without being present at the vehicle testing station for examination. Her arrest comes after four others were previously apprehended in Jeffreys Bay, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town last month. The Hawks Philani Nkwalase said: “The suspect was arrested on 23 April. The suspect, who is a former cashier, was allegedly linked to the capturing of applications to the eNaTIS system.” She is expected to appear at Vredenburg Magistrates Court on Thursday, together with her alleged accomplices who're out on bail. Meanwhile, the Hawks said that more arrests are expected in fraudulent roadworthy certificate cases pending the on-going investigations. Three men, who were arrested in connection with fraudulent roadworthy certificates in Grabouw, were granted bail. Abdi Mohamed Omar (41), Isse Abdulahi Mohamed (32) and Abdullahi Yuseg Ali (31) were arrested earlier in April. They were each granted R1,500 bail following their appearance at the Bellville Magistrates Court. "They are expected to back in court on 4 June. More arrests can be expected on both cases pending the ongoing investigation," Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said.
