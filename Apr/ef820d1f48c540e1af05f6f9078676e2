The Hawks have previously investigated Gordhan related to these allegations, but the case was not pursued. JOHANNESBURG - Pravin Gordhan’s attorney has confirmed that the Public Protector has subpoenaed the minister to submit an affidavit related to the Sars investigation unit or the so-called rogue unit. The Hawks have previously investigated Gordhan over these allegations, but the case was not pursued. It is alleged that Gordhan, a former Sars commissioner, established and presided over a unit within Sars that unlawfully spied on taxpayers. Attorney Tebogo Malatji said they had considered this matter closed. The Public Protector has asked Gordhan to respond by 24 April. However, Malatji said they would ask the Public Protector for an extension. “This is a matter that was raised in 2014 and extensive submissions were made to the then Public Protector.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
