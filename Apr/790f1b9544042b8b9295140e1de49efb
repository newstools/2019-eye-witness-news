Acting commissioner Mark Kingon presented the results on Monday afternoon. PRETORIA – The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has announced it collected R1.28 trillion in 2018/2019, missing its R1.3 trillion target. Acting commissioner Mark Kingon presented the results on Monday afternoon. The Revenue Service has consistently reported shortfalls and missed targets, although under axed commissioner Tom Moyane Sars reached the R1 trillion milestone. The release of the preliminary results will possibly be Kingon's last stint as acting commissioner before Edward Kieswetter takes over on 1 May. Some of his immediate challenges include improving tax compliance and revenues, as well as restoring public confidence in the agency. GOVT’S SHORTFALL On Monday afternoon Sars announced South African tax revenues fell about R15 billion short of government's target in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. South Africa has seen revenue collections fall consistently since 2015 due to weak economic growth and administrative weakness, the latter leading President Cyril Ramaphosa to fire Moyane as revenue service boss in November. Almost a year after Sars boldly announced its R1.3 trillion target, Treasury has confirmed it expects a shortfall of about R15 billion in revenue. Kingon said: “The gross amount collected, in other words prior to refunds, was R1,575.4 billion which was offset by refunds of R287.8 billion.” He said this year’s net revenue outcome represents a growth of 5.8% compared to the last financial year. Kingon said it’s important to note that these are preliminary results and will be subject to a detailed financial audit. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
