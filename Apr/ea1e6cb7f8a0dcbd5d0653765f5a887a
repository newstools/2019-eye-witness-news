JOHANNESBURG - The rand strengthened slightly against the dollar on Friday with other emerging markets, but its gains were capped by a strong dollar ahead of US growth data. At 0655 GMT the rand was 0.42% stronger at R14.3800 per dollar compared with an overnight close of R14.4400. “In tandem with emerging market currencies, the rand struggled to gain traction against a strong greenback as the trade-weighted US dollar continued to benefit from positive data releases,” said NKC African Economics in a morning note. The currency market’s focus is now on the US GDP data, which could reinforce bullishness about the world’s top economy after a slew of numbers this week pointed at an improved outlook. NKC African Economics said it expects the rand to trade between R14.25 and R14.50 rand to the dollar. South African-focused investors will look to any election news ahead of parliamentary and provincial polls on 8 May.
