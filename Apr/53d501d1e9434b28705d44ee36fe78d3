With just nine days to the much-anticipated elections, Ramaphosa was in Mqanduli today as part of the party's campaign. MQANDULI - African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised to address the issues raised by villagers in the Eastern Cape. With just nine days to the much-anticipated elections, Ramaphosa was in Mqanduli today as part of the party's campaign. Ahead of the rally, Ramaphosa went into a kraal to receive a bull from the chief, as his security detail looked on nervously. Bad roads were high on the list of complaints of many residents It was also one of the items on the to-do list that Ramaphosa promised when he campaigned on Sunday. Ten kilometres of gravel road appeared to have been freshly graded ahead of his visit to Chief Manz'olwandle’s Great Place in the district. Still, the road was treacherous and bumpy. Ramaphosa’s remarks on the bad roads were loudly affirmed by the crowd, who travelled to the Great Place from their huts on the surrounding green hills. Eyewitness News asked Lelethu and Anathi, two women from the area in their early twenties, what they want government to do for them after the elections: “Work, and schools and travel, roads, the roads are very bad,' they said. Ramaphosa also told the crowd that there will be no excuses this time around if government officials don’t implement the ANC’s programmes. He said the party will make the development of the area a priority so that Mqanduli isn’t just famous because everyone leaves it to go live in the big cities. The president emphasised agricultural programmes, better roads, and computer tablets for children at schools, which the ANC will deliver. "Let us show the world and the whole country that the people of South Africa want change, they are voting for change to move forward, so that we can continue with our work as the ANC to improve the lives of our people."
