Earlier this week, the airline applied for a court interdict after metal workers union National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa served a notice to strike. JOHANNESBURG - The Labour Court has reserved judgment in Comair's interdict application, meaning the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa)’s strike cannot go ahead until a decision is handed down. The airline approached the court this week after the metal workers union served it with a 48-hour strike notice, and the Labour Court will only hand down judgement on Tuesday. Employees are calling for a change in pay disparities for employees performing similar duties. Comair's Wrenelle Stander said daily operations continue. “The matter was set down at the Labour Court on Thursday morning. We got the outcome that the judgment is being reserved and the strike has been interdicted until the judgment is handed down.” At the same time, Comair has welcomed the Labour Court’s decision to delay its ruling on Numsa’s strike until after the long weekend and said all its flights will operate as scheduled over the busy period. Stander said: “Comair is pleased with the Labour Court decision and the peace of mind this gives our customers. We plan to operate all our flights as normal over the Easter weekend. Also, we’d like to thank our staff for their ongoing commitment and support and wish all our customers a safe and relaxing weekend.”
