The big five sporting federations including cricket, rugby and soccer achieved 50% of the prescribed targets, with soccer scoring the highest with 89%. JOHANNESBURG - Sports Minister Tokozile Xasa has warned of serious repercussions for federations that donâ€™t comply with transformation targets. On Tuesday Xasa released the sixth edition of the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) status report which deals with transformation in sport. The 2017/18 EPG status report has shown a slight improvement compared to the one released last year. The big five sporting federations, including cricket, rugby and soccer, achieved 50% of the prescribed targets, with soccer scoring the highest with 89%. But the sports minister has warned that poor performing bodies such as Athletics South Africa will face serious consequences for their non-compliance. In the past, federations have been banned from hosting and/or bidding to host global tournaments in the country for not meeting transformation targets.
