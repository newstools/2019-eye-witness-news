A poem by Busani Ngcaweni on the burning of books and ever-lasting lifespan of ideas. They burn librariesI wish to write about it But the pen is dryPerhaps it's a nervous condition Or just the recognition of the complexity of problems in higher educationIf not in our polity at large, where books are burnt too Something cooking in their minds The ever restless minds of studentsIn our countryBorn free to vote, Imprisoned by inequality Something strange but understandableWith deep roots in the political economy Complicated by thuggery masquerading as youth leadership Anti intellectualismOf Saharan proportions Maybe we don't get itMaybe we doLike the Tibetan MonksSelf-immolation has becomeour zeitgeist Burn it todayDemand a new one tomorrow Books contain ideas, noble and objectionable Before you burn it, have you read it? Where did it all startWhere will it ever endThe revolution Decolonisation Economic freedom in our lifetimeBring back the land, and the knowledge They burn libraries, and booksBurn burn burn! They call it a revolution asThey burn knowledge, Whose knowledge is it anyway Slavery burned and banned our knowledge, and beingColonialism and apartheid too, burned books but ideas triumphed, Ideas outlive fire, and headlines Flaming the fire of resistanceFreedom! Freedom! Here we are wrestling withOntological dislocationEpistemicide!Our language died too as ourKnowledge systems were Incinerated But the pen is dryAt UKZN the colonial archive lies in ruinFlames rage burn and consume Rhodes has fallenFees too butThe pen is dry Burn burn burn, books, libraries, but ideas will always live!
