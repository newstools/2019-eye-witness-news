Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has granted a request to postpone the testimony of Robert McBride and Johan Booysen. JOHANNESBURG - While former Ipid head Robert McBride was scheduled to testify at the Zondo commission of inquiry, the session has been postponed until Thursday because the implicated parties have not been notified. The former police watchdog body boss was scheduled to testify in February but this was delayed to allow implicated parties the opportunity to respond to his submissions. It emerged on Monday that the legal teams have still not sent out those notices. Evidence leader Advocate Paul Pretorius told the commission that McBride was scheduled to start testifying today and former KwaZulu-Natal Hawks head Johan Booysen on Thursday. "The postponement of the two witnesses has been occasioned by the failure of the legal team to ensure notices to the implicated persons, to enable them to consider evidence applied to cross-examine, had been issued." Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was not happy. "The postponement was granted on 18 February precisely for the purpose that notices should be served on implicated persons. The legal team failed to make sure the notices were sent to implicated persons. That is not acceptable." Zondo adjourned proceedings until Thursday.
