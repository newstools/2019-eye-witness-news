CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule said that sinister forces are behind a call for the ruling party to remove certain individuals from its election list. Magashule said the list is a done deal. He made the statement while campaigning in Hermanus on Wednesday. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called out the ANC for having controversial figures like Magashule on its election list. However, Magashule said that the list will not be amended. “The matter has been finalised and it’s a product of the national executive committee. There a people who are trying to be naughty,” said Magashule. He said the list has been submitted to the Independent Electoral Commission and is therefore final.
