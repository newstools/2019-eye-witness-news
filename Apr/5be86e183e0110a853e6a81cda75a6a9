JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has been warned of possible load shedding during the upcoming winter season. On Wednesday, Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan and Eskom promised less than a month in total of power outages which will hopefully be limited to stage 1 while giving an update on the country’s electricity crisis.
