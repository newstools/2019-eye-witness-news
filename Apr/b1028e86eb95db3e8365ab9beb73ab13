Patricia de Lille's lawyers asked the court to instruct the DA to desist from telling its call centre agents to tell potential voters that she was fired. CAPE TOWN - Former Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille  will not be getting her apology from the Democratic Alliance (DA) just yet. On Wednesday, De Lille approached the Western Cape High Court on an urgent basis to force to the DA to accede to an earlier Electoral Commission of South Africa ruling instructing it to apologise to her for its election telemarketing message that it fired her as mayor. But the court refused to make a ruling on Wednesday on the case’s merits and its urgency. De Lille said the fight was not over and was confident the court would rule in her favour. Her lawyers asked the court to instruct the DA to desist from telling its call centre agents to tell potential voters that it fired De Lille. De Lille told her supporters outside the court that the DA would continue spreading lies about her. “And now they’re beginning to find dirty tricks and lies to try to tarnish my name but as I’ve done in the past, I fought them all the way.” The Good party leader told her supporters the DA had been intent on lying about her in the run-up to the elections. De Lille was accompanied to court by scores of her Good party supporters who filled the public gallery. The DA’s legal representative told the court the party would appeal whatever ruling against it all the way to the Constitutional Court, calling for the matter to be struck off the roll. Judge Robert Martin postponed the matter to Friday for a final determination on the application’s urgency.
