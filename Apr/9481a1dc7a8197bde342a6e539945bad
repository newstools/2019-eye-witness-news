Biafra, officially the Republic of Biafra, was a secessionist state in West Africa which existed from 1967 to 1970 and was made up of the states in the eastern region of Nigeria. The organisation’s South African representative Emeka Ogbonna said that Malema’s anti-xenophobic stance and his African ideology attracted the organisation. Malema also took time to call for an end to xenophobia following recent attacks on foreigners including members of IPOB. "Stop the self-hatred. Stop attacking our brothers and sisters from Africa."
