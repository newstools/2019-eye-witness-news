JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs have confirmed that they've terminated the contracts of midfielder Hendrick Ekstein and striker Gustavo Páez. Ekstein has been stuck in a contractual battle with the Glamour Boys in the past few weeks but on Thursday the club confirmed that they had reached a mutual agreement with the player to terminate the contract. Venezuelan striker Páez has also left the club after a new deal was not offered to him after struggling for game time in recent times since the arrival of coach Ernst Middendorp in December.
