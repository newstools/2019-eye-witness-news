Magashule is on a door-to-door campaign, engaging with residents of the traditional ANC stronghold of Philippi. CAPE TOWN – African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule has kicked off his two-day campaign in Cape Town on Saturday. Magashule went on a door-to-door engaging with residents of the traditional ANC stronghold of Philippi. Magashule said the Western Cape is ripe for the taking and believes the ANC can make inroads after the 8 May elections.  He said there a lot of challenges with people in need of housing and electricity. “People still have hope… in fact, they think that the ANC is in charge of the Western Cape.” Magashule said allegations against him and other ANC leaders won’t have any impact on the governing party. “…We are focusing on elections, people are trying to distract us and [deviate] our attention and focus.” ANC NEEDS TO CONSOLIDATE SUPPORT The ANC needs to consolidate its support in its traditional strongholds if it wants to offer any real competition to the Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape. That’s according to Magashule. Magashule said as much as the ANC has to focus on its core base in traditional strongholds, the party will be taking the fight to the DA-controlled areas. “…In the next week, we will be going all over the Western Cape and where the DA is actually in charge.” Magashule will continue his campaign in the Cape Town Metro on Sunday.
