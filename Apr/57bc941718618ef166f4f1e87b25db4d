Malcolm Marx will continue to captain the side in the place of Warren Whiteley who is on the standby list. JOHANNESBURG - The Lions have named their 26-man squad for their three-match tour of Australia and New Zealand. Malcolm Marx will continue to captain the side in the place of Warren Whiteley who is on the standby list. The Johannesburg side will be without front rower Dylan Smith who has a fractured cheekbone while young loose forwards Vincent Tshituka and Ruan Vermaak will also miss the trip due to hand and ankle injuries respectively. The Lions will look to overturn their disappointing 42-5 loss to the Sharks at home last Friday. Their first match on tour will be against the Brumbies in Canberra on Saturday before travelling to Hamilton to face the Chiefs and end off their tour against the Crusaders in Christchurch.
