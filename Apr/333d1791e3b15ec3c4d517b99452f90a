At 1500 GMT the rand traded at 14.40 to the dollar, a 1.03% retreat from its New York close on Tuesday.

Consumer confidence dipped in the first quarter of 2019 to +2 from +7 in the final quarter of 2018. Consumers were neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the outlook two weeks ahead of a national election seen as a referendum on the economy. “The consumer confidence number was very disappointing. Consumers are not confident, they don’t have money, the cost of living is rising. That had a negative impact on sentiment towards the currency,” said Maudi Lentsoane, portfolio manager at Lehumo Investments.
