JOHANNESBURG – As the general election draws closer, the African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng is set to give an update on its election campaign. The party will also officially open the ANC pavilion to showcase its road to the election at the Rand Show in Nasrec on Friday. With less than 20 days before the 8 May national and provincial elections, the ANC in Gauteng said this was an opportunity to reflect on its campaign. The party said its pavilion at the Rand Show would be open to visitors to the annual show which celebrates its 125th anniversary this year. “When we take you through the pavilion we are demonstrating in numbers what are our achievements. So, that’s solid, it’s facts [and] it can’t be disputed that we have done very well, not just in delivering services, but also improving on governance, ethics, fighting corruption and working towards a clean government in Gauteng,” said ANC provincial campaign head Lebogang Maila. Gauteng is expected to be one of several highly contested provinces at the polls, with the governing party looking at retaining control. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa visited Alexandra two weeks ago following unrest in the area over service delivery protests. The party said it had developed a strategy that will help it attract voters from different backgrounds. The Rand Show is set to run for the next 10 days. #ANCRandshow seen at the ANC stand at the Rand Show which runs until Sunday.
