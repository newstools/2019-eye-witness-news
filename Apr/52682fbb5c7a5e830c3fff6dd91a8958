The number of teachers who are absent from school on a daily basis has increased from 8 to 10% since the last survey was conducted in 2011. JOHANNESBURG - A recent school monitoring survey has revealed there's been an increase in teacher absenteeism in the country. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga on Monday released the findings of the 2017 survey. According to the assessment, the number of teachers who are absent from school on a daily basis has increased from 8 to 10% since the last survey was conducted in 2011. Motshekga said she was concerned about the increase and minister described the 2% hike in teacher absenteeism since 2011 as deeply troubling, adding that more needs to be done to support teachers in the country. Motshekga said there was a need to interrogate the statistics to understand what she described as the ”leave of absence phenomenon.” On a positive note, the survey has found that more pupils in poor and rural schools have access to libraries compared to 2011 and that great strides have been made to ensure children have textbooks at schools. The minister has, however, congratulated the Limpopo and Free State provinces for achieving the lowest teacher absence in the survey. Motshekga said her department has also increased the number of classrooms and new schools built across the country over the past 18 years.
