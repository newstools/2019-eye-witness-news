Guy Noves, who had sought 2.9 million in damages, became the first France coach ever to be sacked, in December 2017, after a meagre seven wins from 22 matches. TOULOUSE - The French rugby federation was ordered by an industrial tribunal Monday to pay â‚¬1 million in compensation to sacked national coach Guy Noves. Noves, who had sought 2.9 million in damages, became the first France coach ever to be sacked, in December 2017, after a meagre seven wins from 22 matches alongside 14 defeats and a humiliating home draw with 2019 World Cup hosts Japan. Under Noves, France lost six consecutive games between June and November 2017, a string of results that federation chief Bernard Laporte deemed unacceptable.
