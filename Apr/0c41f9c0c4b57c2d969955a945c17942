WATCH: I would say he was brave - Brother of deceased Caledon protester  A delegation from the Theewaterskloof Municipality, including the executive mayor and municipal manager, has met with a committee representing residents. It shared details of a project that will deliver just over 1,000 housing opportunities. But municipal spokesperson Hugo Geldenhuys warned that it will take time: “We will drive the process as quickly as we can.
