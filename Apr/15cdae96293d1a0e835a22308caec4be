CAPE TOWN - Four people have been arrested in connection with the shooting of a six-year-old girl in Worcester, Western Cape. The child was sitting at the back of a truck driving in the Avian Park area when she got caught in the crossfire. The little girl - who was on her way home from school at the time - was airlifted to a hospital following Monday’s shooting. “Police who were attending to a complaint of a fight between rivals gangs managed to arrest four suspects. A police sergeant was injured on the leg when community members pelted the officers with stones. He was admitted to a hospital for medical treatment,” police spokesperson Frederick van Wyk said. This incident comes about two days after a seven-year-old girl was shot in the head during a gang crossfire in Manenberg. She is in a stable condition in hospital. (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
