She says there are 34 parties contesting the 2019 election; 20 of those parties are new. On whether Patricia de Lille’s Good party will make a dent in the province; Verwoerd says the party made a mistake to try and run a national campaign, adding that it would’ve been far better for them to stick to the Western or Northern Cape. “The party registered and launched late. The party is a bit young to poll properly, but the polls are showing somewhere between 1.5% votes in the province.” Verwoerd adds that the polls show that there are no threats to the Democratic Alliance (DA).
