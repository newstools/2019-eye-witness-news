The world champion 400m runner was due to make his return in the 400m heats on Thursday afternoon. CAPE TOWN - World champion 400m runner Wayde van Niekerk has pulled out of the National Athletic Championship. The 26-year-old  said he did not want to take any chances with his return after a lengthy injury layoff as the conditions were not ideal.  Niekerk was due to make his return in the 400m heats on Thursday afternoon. There has been rainfall in Germiston which resulted in a wet track and therefore van Niekerk did not want to take the risk. The 400m world record holder missed the entire 2018 season due to a knee ligament injury sustained in a celebrity tag rugby match. He will most likely to be back on the track in the European season in what will be a build-up to the IAAF World Championships in Doha in September.
