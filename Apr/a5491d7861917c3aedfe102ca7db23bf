He confirmed his department was dealing with a number of legal claims from the families of those affected by the tragedy. “Others have already executed the actions that they threatened to prepare documents for court or serve court papers on us,” Lesufi said. Lesufi said the claims included trauma and medical bills. “We are working on that one and I hope both parties can each find the middle ground that is acceptable,” he said. The MEC said while he was happy with work done to construct the walkway, he believed a ceremony should be held in honour of those who lost their lives.
