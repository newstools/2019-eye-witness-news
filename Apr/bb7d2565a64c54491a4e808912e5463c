Magashule is in Cape Town to garner support for the ANC in the only province not governed by the party. CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule says he's not fazed by the allegations of corruption levelled against him, adding it won't distract the party from its election campaign. Magashule is in Cape Town to garner support for the ANC in the only province not governed by the party. Magashule kicked off his two-day campaign in Cape Town on Saturday morning. Magashule went door-to-door engaging with residents of the traditional ANC stronghold of Philippi. He arrived in Cape Town a day after controversial book Gangster State was launched in the city. Magashule said corruption allegations contained in the book won’t affect the party’s focus. “It’s a non-issue, we are focusing on the elections. People are trying to distract us.” He said the party will continue to take corruption seriously: “The ANC is against corruption, we will work hard. It is not going to distract us at all.”
