Former Ipid head Robert McBride has testified about the events leading up to his arrest and those of then Hawks boss Anwa Dramat and the provincial head of the unit, Shadrack Sibiya, in separate cases. McBride has testified how false allegations of impropriety and criminal conduct were used as the pretext to suspend and prosecute officials perceived as obstacles to efforts to capture the institutions.

They were all falsely accused of wrongdoing then suspended and later hauled off to court on trumped-up charges.McBride discussed the significance of these events. "When we were, in essence, the mainstay of an independent organisation that exercises investigative oversight over the police of South Africa, this is what was done to us.
