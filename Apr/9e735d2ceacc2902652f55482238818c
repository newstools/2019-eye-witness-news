LONDON - England have named their preliminary World Cup squad and squads for matches against Ireland and Pakistan on Wednesday: The hosts get the tournament underway against South Africa on 30 May. Young all-rounder Jofra Archer will have a chance to press his case for World Cup selection after the uncapped 24-year-old was included in a 17-man squad for next month's one-day internationals against Ireland and Pakistan. The dynamic Barbados-born all-rounder was left out of the 15-man preliminary World Cup squad also announced on Wednesday.
