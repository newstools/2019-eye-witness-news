MADRID - A skyscraper housing embassies in Madrid was evacuated on Tuesday after a bomb threat was received by telephone at the Australian embassy there, a police spokeswoman said. The 57-storey, 235-metre high Torre Espacio, one of four towers located in the Spanish capital’s financial district, also houses the embassies of Britain and Canada. A British embassy spokeswoman said its staff had been evacuated around midday (1000 GMT) and were safely outside the building. The Australian embassy said on Twitter: “The @AusEmbEsp will remain closed for the rest of today, Tuesday 16 April, until further notice. Apologies for any inconvenience.” TV footage showed a police cordon and fire trucks outside the building. “The usual emergency protocol was activated immediately,” the police spokeswoman said.
