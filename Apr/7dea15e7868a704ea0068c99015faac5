CAPE TOWN - The case of a former Sans Souci Girls' High School learner who's facing a charge of assault has been postponed to May. The 16-year-old appeared in court on Monday for a second appearance in-camera and her lawyers have requested a postponement. She and her ex-teacher were thrust into the limelight in February after a heated exchange between them was caught on camera. Both opened a criminal case against the other following the incident. The grade nine pupil's mother also removed her from the Newlands school, while a disciplinary process was under way. She has since found a place at another school.
