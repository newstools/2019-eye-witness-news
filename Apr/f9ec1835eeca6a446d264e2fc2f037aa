JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Aids Council (SANAC) said it had received a critical funding boost of over R5 billion to go towards the fighting of TB, HIV and Aids. Deputy President David Mabuza on Friday attended the official hand over of the money to SANAC by the Global Grant Fund. SANAC CEO Sandile Buthelezi said the money was important because it would mostly cover treatments and for vulnerable groups who suffered from the life-threatening diseases.

In addition, 90% of that budget will go towards TB,” he said.
