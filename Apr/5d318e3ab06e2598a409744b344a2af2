Meko admitted this has had an impact on campaigning on the ground. “I will admit that it has the potential to divert the campaign. The processes of the ANC of the list have long been closed and the focus now is to ensure that the remaining few days consolidate the victory of the ANC,” he said. Magashule is expected to meet more communities in Viljoenskroon. The ANC secretary-general is a former ANC chairperson and premier for nearly twenty years in the province now riddled with divisions about the party candidate list.
