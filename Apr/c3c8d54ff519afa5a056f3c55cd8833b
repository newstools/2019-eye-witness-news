CAPE TOWN - Election observers from religious and civil society groups are calling on political parties in the Western Cape to tone down their campaign rhetoric. Cape Town Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, who chairs the Electoral Code of Conduct Observer Commission, said that character assassination is as devastating as physical violence. Makgoba said a free and fair election is not determined only by what happens on election day, but by attitudes and activities in the run-up to the election. Elections are unfortunately usually characterised by mudslinging. But Makgoba is giving a rare voice of reason to the upcoming polls. He said a free and fair election is not determined only by what happens on election day, but by attitudes and activities in the run-up. Makgoba wants political leaders to show some respect for each other. “Let’s not play the man, let’s the play the ball. Let the values of respect characterise who we are.” He warned that character assassination is as devastating as physical violence.
