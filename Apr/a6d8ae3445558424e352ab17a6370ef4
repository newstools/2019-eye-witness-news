The UDM leader was cross-examined at the inquiry on Wednesday following his open letter to the president in which he accused the investment companies of being 'in bed' with the former PIC CEO Dan Matjila. JOHANNESBURG - United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa says he is still concerned about the proximity of two investment companies to the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) and wants the commission of inquiry to investigate. Holomisa was cross-examined at the inquiry on Wednesday following his open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa  in which he accused investment companies, Lebashe Investment Group and Harith General Partners of being “in bed” with the former PIC CEO Dan Matjila to benefit from funding deals. Danny Berger, who represents the companies, said Holomisa could not defame people in such a way without evidence. “The proximity of your clients to the PIC is worrisome,” Holomisa said. Berger responded by asking: “[Do] you describe it as a cartel?” “Yes I stand by that, that the commission will rule on that,” Holomisa said. Meanwhile, Harith described Holomisa's comments as malicious and false attacks on the company which they say have continued despite a court interdict preventing him from doing so. "As expected, Mr Holomisa’s responses to cross-examination lacked credibility and provided little of substance. He was unable to produce any concrete facts to substantiate his claims. Harith will continue robustly to defend its reputation and we look forward to further progress in this regard as the cross examination of Mr Holomisa will continue at the Inquiry on Monday," Harith indicated in a statement.
