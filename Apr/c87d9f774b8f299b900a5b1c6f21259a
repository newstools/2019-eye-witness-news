Hundreds of land claimants are seeking answers from the State on when restitution in the form of land will be delivered. CAPE TOWN - The Rural Development and Land Reform Minister has been ordered to appear before the Western Cape High Court to give answers on the District Six restitution matter. Hundreds of land claimants are seeking answers from the State on when restitution in the form of land will be delivered. Wednesday’s contempt of court application follows government’s inadequate response to a November 2018 court ruling in which it was ordered to come up with a comprehensive plan. Judge Yasmin Meer has dismissed Nkoana-Mashabane's request for a postponement of today's contempt of court application. Meer says the minister's counsel has failed to come up with an adequate explanation for why a postponement should be granted. Instead the judge has ruled in favour of the claimants, ordering Nkoana-Mashabane to appear before court on 17 May. Meer has also ordered the minister to file an answering affidavit to today's application by 6 May. In this affidavit, the minister will have to explain what steps she's taken to adhere to the November 2018 ruling, why she should not be held in contempt of court, and why she should not personally be ordered to pay the legal costs.
