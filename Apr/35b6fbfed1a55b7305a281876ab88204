JOHANNESBURG – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has paid tribute to late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her long-time personal assistant Zodwa Zwane. Maimane visited Sis Zodwa - as she is affectionately known - at her home in Dobsonville, Soweto, where he also comes from. Zwane welcomed the DA leader dressed in her ANC colours. He said he chose Easter Monday for the visit as it is the same holiday on which Madikizela-Mandela died last year, and to express his condolences on the passing of Zwane's brother.
