Police say the deceased suspects and the suspect in custody have been linked to the taxi industry, but he would not specify whether they were drivers. CAPE TOWN - Police have revealed a suspect is in custody in connection with a deadly taxi shooting in Hout Bay. A second suspect was killed in that shooting, which claimed four lives and wounded two passengers last week. Police Minister Bheki Cele met with taxi bosses and community members in the area on Monday. #CeleHoutBay One of the main issues that’ll be discussed is the taxi violence that’s been on-going in the area over the past few weeks. Taxi associations are also here incl SANTACO, CATA & Codeta.

The investigations have now uncovered who initiated the shooting and who responded to it. When I refer to the arrested, it’s those who allegedly initiated it.” He says both the deceased suspects and the suspect in custody have been linked to the taxi industry, but he would not specify whether they were drivers. Vearey said police were searching for one more suspect. Firearms have been confiscated and ballistics tests are being done. PROVINCIAL POLICE Responding to residents' concerns over corrupt police officers, the minister used the moment to take a quick jab at a major DA election promise to strive for provincial police should the party win the elections. Cele was sitting next to the DA's Western Cape premier candidate Alan Winde at the community meeting. “There’s no provincial police. All police are national. There are no provincial police.” Winde responded and said: “No, not yet.” (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
