Mashaba used his address to talk tough on undocumented immigrants in the city and reiterated his views on the matter. “There can be no doubt that the immigration crisis in South Africa is adding pressure on the government to provide services with our limited funding.” Mashaba said the ANC had ignored the immigration problem for far too long. “Illegal immigration will not be treated with any level of importance until a different party occupies the Union Buildings after 8 May.” This prompted ANC councillors to walk out.
