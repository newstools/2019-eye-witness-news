EFF President Julius Malema attributed the violent behaviour of some party members to socialisation, saying some among them were still unlearning old patterns. JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says despite recent displays of violent behaviour by some party members, there will be no place for violence in an EFF government should it win the elections. Malema was speaking on the Eusebius McKaizer Show on Radio 702 earlier on Thursday where he attributed violent behaviour to socialisation, saying some among them were still unlearning old patterns. #MalemaWithEusebius Malema says there will be no space for violence under the EFF.

They forget the pain we have gone through as black people. That anger shows itself from time to time. In the EFF, we try and control it,” Malema said. The EFF's election manifesto contains a list of interventions the party would implement to deal with the abnormal levels of violence against women and non-binary gendered people in society. #MalemawithEusebiusMalema says where violence raises it's head, a fighter should know that it's time to leave.

The South African Reserve Bank’s economic growth forecast for 2020 is 1.8%. Malema said nationalising land and mines and dealing with illicit financial outflows would restore the country's economy. The party is one of 48 contesting the elections on 8 May.
