The boy disappeared late last month. SF pic.twitter.com/vGT7v9GuIe  Eyewitness News spoke to parents who attended the service who said that they were distraught. One parent said: “I am shocked because first of all, we know the mother and the boy and seeing that we’re raising children, it’s very hard knowing that your children are growing up in a community where these things happen. It makes you feel unsafe.” A friend of the toddler’s mother is expected to make a second court appearance on Tuesday on charges of kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice.” (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
