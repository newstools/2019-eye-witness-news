Thousands of Gauteng pupils will start with the computer practicals exam on Wednesday morning. JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said all precautions had been taken to ensure that the first day of matric exams get off without a hitch. Thousands of Gauteng pupils will start with the computer practicals exam on Wednesday morning. Lesufi said all papers were kept in a safe place to prevent any possible leaks. Security has also been heightened at exam venues. “An extensive network of monitors has been established across the province to assist all our monitors and invigilators to know the new terms, but most importantly, to monitor and invigilate this examination in a proper format without necessarily invading the privacy of our learners.” In the Western Cape, many grade 12s don't only have to contend with the stress of the exams period but other issues such as crime and fickle public transport. Education MEC Debbie Shafer said many pupils rely on public transport. “We hope to have the support of transport operators during this period. We also have to be aware that accidents or other events can happen, roads could be blocked and traffic could be heavy. We appeal to candidates to leave early so as to make up for possible delays.” If there are delays of more than an hour in getting to exam venues, pupils will be able to write supplementary in June 2020.
