The EFF leader accused Pravin Gordhan of going to state-owned enterprises to remove black people and of being a dog of white monopoly capital. JOHANNESBURG - Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan's application against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has been dismissed with costs. The Equality Court handed down judgment on Thursday morning. Judge Roland Sutherland has ruled that while the comments by Malema may indeed be hateful, they did not fall within the terms of the Equality Act. Last year Gordhan approached the courts over the EFF leader's 2018 remarks that he was a dog of white monopoly capital. Malema also accused Gordhan of being behind the purging of black workers at state-owned enterprises. The EFF’s Godrich Gardee has welcomed today's judgment. “It’s only the political parties and the opposition in particular that can hold the state accountable, hold the ruling party accountable. In the absence of the political speeches and political rights and the rights of freedom of speech of the political opposition, we might as well close shop.” Gordhan’s team said they were studying the judgment.
