The former president said he believed the Pietermaritzburg High Court made a mistake when it denied his application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma is confident that the Supreme Court of Appeal may overturn the High Court’s decision. #Zuma appears relaxed in court. With his iconic laugh, he greets some of his supporters behind him. Zuma is expected to address thousands of people outside the court later today. @NkoRaphael pic.twitter.com/pR2R6Afvvo  His spokesperson Vukile Mathabela said Zuma still believed he was being targeted politically and another court may be sympathetic to him. “That’s why you look at the court system when you’re not happy, then you go to the higher court. That’s how the law works.” Zuma has until 1 November to file papers to appeal the court decision. The matter will be heard on 22 November.
