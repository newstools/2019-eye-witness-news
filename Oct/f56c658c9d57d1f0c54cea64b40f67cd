CAPE TOWN - There's still no clarity as to when police will appoint a commissioner for the Western Cape. Police Minister Bheki Cele has apparently stepped in and stopped the process. This comes after Major-General Jeremy Vearey lodged a complaint with police management after his application for the post was tampered with. Police spokesperson Vish Naidoo, however, said that the process remained ongoing. "The process is still ongoing. I can't tell you much more. When we are done, we will make a proper announcement." Police were expected to complete the process in August.
