The Money Show’s Bruce Whitfield asked Jeanette Marais for five tips for those who have left it late. (Note: Marais is with Momentum Metropolitan Life Limited.

Merely putting your money in the bank guarantees the loss of buying power.  For more detail, listen to the interview in the audio below.  Enjoy The Money Show, but miss it sometimes?
