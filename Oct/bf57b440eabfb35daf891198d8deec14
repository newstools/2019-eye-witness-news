Although many of the suggested solutions are already contained in existing policies including the National Development Plan, the party said it would focus on the implementation thereof. JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) said its national executive committee had agreed on a package of economic interventions to help grow the struggling economy and create jobs. Although many of the suggested solutions are already contained in existing policies including the National Development Plan, the party said it would focus on the implementation thereof. Addressing reporters in Johannesburg on Wednesday following the special NEC held over the weekend, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said they reached agreements on how macroeconomic policy could support job creation, a reimagined industrial strategy and the importance of investment in infrastructure. “The talks were very frank, engaging and wonderful. I think the media must capture that mood of positivity so that we make sure society in South Africa has the positive mood to rebuild,” Magashule said. The party has also noted the contested economic recovery plan drafted by the National Treasury, which was discussed at the meeting without fully declaring either its endorsement or rejection.
