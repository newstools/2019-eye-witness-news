From there they moved to the Areyeng bus terminal. Mbalula was impressed with what he'd seen so far. "We are improving it, it must be replicated everywhere and that is exactly what we are doing with the new trains. You see, the Gautrain is something else." People with disabilities often had to grapple with a number of obstacles when trying to move around, especially when using public transport. Government's hoping this will soon be a thing of the past with easier access and convenience.
