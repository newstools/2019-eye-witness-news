Bob Hewitt may still apply for parole after the Correctional Supervision Parole Review Board set aside the convicted rapist’s parole placement on Friday. JOHANNESBURG – The department of correctional services said convicted rapist and former tennis star Bob Hewitt can apply for parole again once all recommendations of the review board have been considered. The board has set aside the 79-year-old's parole placement. The department said the parole board failed to adhere to Section 75 of the Correctional Services Act when they initially considered his parole. He was set to be released last month before Justice Minister Ronald Lamola ordered a review of the parole board’s decision. Hewitt was sentenced to six years in jail in 2016 for the rape and sexual assault of two women he coached decades ago. The department's Singabakho Nxumalo said, “They also looked at the entire profile of the inmate and also suggested that there be other interventions, that we cannot [disclose] to the public. All those are a necessity before he gets to be considered again for parole placement." Meanwhile, following the review and setting aside of Hewitt's parole, one of his victims said she is glad he will remain behind bars. The parole review board has set aside the decision to grant him parole saying the former tennis star's victims and their families were not notified about his application to be released from prison. Olivia Jasriel who was sexually assaulted by Hewitt said justice has prevailed. “I am very happy about the outcome; I think they did the right thing. I don’t believe that we should have been put through what we had to go through in order to get the system to work for us.” She said she is grateful that the justice minister got involved.
