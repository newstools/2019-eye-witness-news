South Africa conceded another penalty just before the half time break, as Biggar reduced the gap to 3 points once again. The sides went into the half time break with a 9-3 lead. Wales were also dealt a massive blow just before the half ended with George North pulling up and having to go off the field. Wales would get the first points of the second half through a Biggar penalty after 5 minutes of play. It was a nervy opening 10 minutes, especially from South Africa with a number of knock-ons and handling errors with both teams struggling to assert any kind of authority on the match. The moment that everyone was waiting for came in the 58th minute as Damian de Allende showed some good strength to hold off two Welsh defenders and crash over the line as the Boks finally managed to string a few phases together. South Africa leading 16-9 heading into the final 20 minutes. Wales looked to hit back straight away and managed to put together a number of phases close to the Bok try line.
