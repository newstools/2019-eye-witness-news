Demonstrators want the Transport Department to roll out a commuter-centred safety plan for women, children, the elderly and the physically-challenged. Zukiswa Vuka of #UniteBehind said they specifically wanted to highlight the gender-based violence women and children experienced while using public transport. “Nothing is being done. For example on Metrorail, we don’t have a commuter-centred safety plan.” Sonke Gender Justice and #UniteBehind have surveyed 1,000 women who rely on public transport in the Western Cape and Gauteng and the findings of that report will also be submitted to Parliament.
