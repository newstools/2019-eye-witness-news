The power utility's Dikatso Mothae said Eskom managed to maintain stability at its Medupi Power Station. The cash-strapped state-owned enterprise introduced four days of rotational power cuts last week due to a damaged conveyor belt. Mothae said the utility was hoping for no unplanned breakdowns. “The system is looking much better and we don’t see the need to load shed this week.” #POWERALERT 1Date: 24 October 2019No loadshedding is expected today@SABCNewsOnline @IOL @eNCA @ewnupdates @SAgovnews @TheCitizen_News @News24 @BDliveSA @TimesLIVE pic.twitter.com/0ut8NTRmSN
