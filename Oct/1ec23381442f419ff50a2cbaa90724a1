A 21-year-old was abducted outside Tygerberg Hospital and sexually assaulted. CAPE TOWN - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has upgraded security measures following the attack on a nursing student last month. A 21-year-old was abducted outside Tygerberg Hospital and sexually assaulted. Police said that no one had been arrested yet. CPUT’s Lauren Kansley said there had been security upgrades across all campuses. “These include two dedicated rapid response vehicles on campus for emergencies, stronger access controls and CCTV cameras, better lighting, improved monitoring of licence plate numbers and extended operating hours for the campus clinic.” Students protesting against gender-based violence handed a list of demands over to university management last month.
