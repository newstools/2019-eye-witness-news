Mark Willemse has been at loggerheads with the DA after he controversially backed a no-confidence motion against former mayor Elenore Bouw Spies. CAPE TOWN - Knysna Mayor Mark Willemse faces an uncertain future as the Democratic Alliance (DA) revoked his membership. Willemse has been at loggerheads with the DA after he controversially backed a no-confidence motion against former mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies. The town's municipal manager Sitembele Vatala was informed by the party on Monday that he was no longer a DA member. Willemse said on Wednesday he would be taking the matter on review to the High Court. “I am very disappointed in the leadership of the DA. I’ve always been a loyal member of the DA, which was very close to my heart. I am applying for an urgent interdict to prevent this from happening, as it is our contention that I am still a member of the DA.”
