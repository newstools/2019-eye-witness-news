Mmusi Maimane made the announcement on Thursday morning on Twitter. JOHANNESBURG - Mmusi Maimane has resigned from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and as the party's Member of Parliament. Maimane made the announcement on Thursday morning on Twitter and the DA's Solly Malatsi confirmed it to Eyewitness News. He resigned as party leader on Wednesday but had indicated he would remain party leader in Parliament.  It’s been a roller coaster of a week for the DA. Not soon after Helen Zille was back in the fold as the party’s Federal Council chair, three senior leaders walked away. They slammed the organisation for deviating from its promises of building a non-racial South Africa. When Maimane resigned on Wednesday, he said the party was no longer best suited to carry the idea of one South Africa for all. On Thursday morning, development throws the DA further into disarray as it scrambles to regroup. The party’s federal executive will meet on Thursday to discuss how best to deal with the crisis.
