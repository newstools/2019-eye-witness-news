There was mudslinging civil disobedience campaigns protests and political infighting over e-tolls. JOHANNESBURG - The Transport Department said it would give more clarity on the status of e-tolls after Thursday morning’s scheduled post-Cabinet briefing. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement that Gauteng motorists must pay up and that Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula would give more details. Mbalula's spokesperson Ayanda Allie-Paine said the minister would issue a statement on Thursday. “The ministry of transport will issue a statement that will serve as a status update.” There were mudslinging civil disobedience campaigns protests and political infighting over e-tolls. But almost six years since the implementation of the controversial system, the gantries are still standing and the majority of motorists are not paying.
