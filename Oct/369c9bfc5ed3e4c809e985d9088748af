The NPA's Asset Forfeiture Unit obtained a court order for her belongings to be placed under curatorship. JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) confirmed that its Asset Forfeiture Unit seized assets belonging to former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede in Umhlanga on Thursday morning. The unit, together with the Hawks and SAPS,obtained a court order for her belongings to be placed under curatorship. Gumede and several of her co-accused face charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering relating to a 2016 waste collection tender worth over R200 million. She maintained she was innocent but the African National Congress suspended her for months before removing her from her mayoral position in August. The NPA's Natasha Kara said: “Due to the order, the assets will be put under curatorship pending the outcome of the criminal case. I understand that the property doesn’t belong to the ex-mayor, just the assets in there [are hers].” Meanwhile, Gumede’s spokesperson Mzomuhle Dube said she rented the property while she was mayor and moved out when she was axed. “Ms Gumede does not own that property. What assets did they take? If the property does not belong to her then why would they say the assets belonged to her? Those people are desperate. They never had a case. This is a desperate move.” Dube described the operation as a beautiful camera action stunt choreographed by the Hawks.
