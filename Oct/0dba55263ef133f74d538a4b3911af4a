JOHANNESBURG - The rand firmed on Thursday, as the dollar retreated on global markets, with safe-haven demand for the US currency waning as investors grew optimistic about a trade deal between the United States and China. At 1530 GMT, the rand traded at R15.0650 versus the dollar, 0.72% stronger than its previous close. “USD/ZAR15.00 is a viable breaking point if the US-Sino trade negotiations prove meaningful yet should the discourse crumble, moves to the upside will be far more severe,” RMB analyst Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana said in a note. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against six major currencies, was on track for its biggest daily drop in five weeks.
