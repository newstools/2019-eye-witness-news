ANC national chair Gwede Mantashe delivered the keynote address at the O.R. Tambo memorial lecture in Kalkfontein on Sunday. CAPE TOWN - African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Gwede Mantashe said now that he was in government, he had a better grasp of the extent of corruption. Delivering the keynote address at the ANC Dullah Omar Region's O.R. Tambo memorial lecture in Kalkfontein on Sunday, Mantashe reminded party members of the ethical and incorruptible character of struggle icon Oliver Tambo. Mantashe praised Tambo as a leader who could learn from the collective experience of working with people; he celebrated the struggle icon's character in politics and his private life. Mantashe said the party would have to deal with outcomes of the Zondo State Capture Commission of inquiry. “I know that very little did we know in Luthuli House about the depth of rot but once you are in government, you begin to feel it and you also begin to see. You can't see that from Luthuli House." Mantashe stressed that the commission would allow the ruling party to better understand how deep the root of corruption is. “It should not be necessary for the chief justice to talk about the Zondo Commission. It is us who must talk about it and defend it and say it must continue its work, finish it, give us a report and if there are consequences, we must face the consequences," he added. BRILLIANT MINDS During his address, Mantashe said the ANC must be the home of the most brilliant minds in society. “Are we still a revolutionary movement? Yes, we are.” He said the ANC must represent the most scientific developments in society. “If the (science) students from CPUT, UCT and Stellenbosch are not part of the ANC’s (work), then something is wrong with us. There’s nothing wrong with them. We need the most brilliant brains.”
