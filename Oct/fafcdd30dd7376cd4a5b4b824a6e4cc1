The DA's federal council is meeting to elect new leaders after Mmusi Maimane resigned from leadership, Parliament and the party last week. Maimane's departure from the DA has not only left a void in the party. It has also caused some of its provincial leaders to jostle for the top position. Bonginkosi Madikizela leads the party's biggest support base. "I still believe that I have unfinished business in the province but some of the people feel very strongly that they will be nominating me and I can't stand in the way of the people who will be nominating me." Madikizela said that he had a lot to offer for the Western Cape but added that the party's best interest should be placed above everything.
