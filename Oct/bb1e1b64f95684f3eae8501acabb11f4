JOHANNESBURG - The Pietermaritzburg High Court has dismissed Jacob Zuma’s application for a permanent stay of prosecution with costs. Earlier this year, the former president, who faces charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering related to the multi-billion-rand Arms Deal, argued in court why he wanted his case to be struck off the roll.
