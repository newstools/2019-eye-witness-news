MultiChoice CEO Mark Rayner concedes that the service should have given subscribers a heads up about the new billing system.  MultiChoice South Africa CEO Mark Rayner has apologised to DStv subscribers who were affected by changes to its billing system. A number of subscribers reported being overcharged on their monthly bills. Rayner advises that DStv has implemented a new billing in an effort to simplify account payments for a range of services. In consolidating the process, DStv Price Lock customers were billed in advance, in a once-off adjustment, to align payment dates. DStv Price Lock customers were billed twice for a specific line item on their accounts, Rayner explains. In the month of October, the customers got billed twice for that component.  Subscribers have been reassured that this once-off adjustment will not affect the overall cost or duration of their Price Lock contracts. We tried to consolidate our complicated account structure. In doing that, we made a couple of slip-ups.  Rayner apologises for not notifying DStv subscribers about the billing changes in advance. We can't be excused for making that clear to customers upfront.  We certainly don't believe we did a good job of communicating. We do apologise for that.
