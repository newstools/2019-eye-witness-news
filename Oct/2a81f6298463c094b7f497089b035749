Aiden  Markram will miss the third Test against India due to a wrist injury after striking something in frustration. Proteas batsman Aiden Markram has been ruled out of the third and final Freedom Series Test match after sustaining an injury to his right wrist during the second match in Pune. The injury took place following the opener’s dismissal in the second innings of the match that saw India go on to win by an innings and 137 runs. Markram was dismissed without scoring in both innings and in a moment of frustration lashed out at a solid object, resulting in his injury. Markram will return to South Africa following the injury with no replacement called up to the squad. "It’s sad to be going home on this note and I completely understand what I’ve done wrong and take full accountability for it. It’s unacceptable in a Proteas environment and to let the team down is what hurts me the most," he said. "I’ve learned a lot from this and the other players I’m sure, have learned from it as well. We understand in sport that emotions run high and sometimes the frustration gets the better of you as it did for me, but like I said, it’s no excuse. I’ve taken full responsibility for it, I have apologised to the team and hopefully I can make it up to them and the people of South Africa soon," Markram added. Team doctor, Hashendra Ramjee said a CT scan revealed a fracture to his wrist bones. “The medical team has therefore ruled him out of the next Test match against India. Arrangements have been made for him to see a specialist on his return to South Africa for further management of the injury”, Ramjee said. The third Test gets under way from Ranchi on Saturday.
