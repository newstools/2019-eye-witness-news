The DA's Deputy Federal Chair Mike Waters says the party needs to go back to what it once was before, if it wants to reconnect with voters. Waters is in the race for the position of the DA Federal Council chairperson, alongside former DA leader Helen Zille and others who are contesting. RELATED: Zille: People putting my name forward are trying to heal the party Waters says the internal election of the Federal Council chair is an opportunity to turn things around for the party. He believes that the organisation needs to let go of policies such as BEE and return to its roots of classical liberalism and non-racialism. I believe we [the DA] need to reconnect with our voters... we continue to bleed voters.  I believe we have to go back to our roots of classical liberalism and non-racialism.  We need to drop issues like race-based BEE and become the party of opportunity and aspiration. I believe that will resonate with the majority of voters in the country.  As I've said before, I do not support BEE, it's a race-based policy and it doesn't work.  Waters has denied claims that he's behind the media leaks attempting to discredit DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Maimane has been facing damning allegations that his lifestyle has been funded by corrupt business figures.
