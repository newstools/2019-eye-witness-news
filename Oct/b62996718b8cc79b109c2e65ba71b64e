Ramaphosa said that the country had no option but to increase levels of investment through infrastructure development. He made the remarks during an oral reply session in the National Assembly where he was answering questions about inequality and the economy. President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed MPs about the country’s dire economic situation a day after Finance Minister Tito Mboweni delivered a similarly gloomy assessment of the country’s economy. He said that infrastructure development had to be prioritised if the country wanted to grow the economy. "Now vital in the effort to drive investment is our infrastructure build programme. We've said in the past that infrastructure was one of the key drivers of economic growth which has served us well in the past."
