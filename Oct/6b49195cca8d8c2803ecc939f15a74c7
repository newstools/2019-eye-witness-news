The organisation, Not In My Name, said Ninow deserved to be in prison forever. They said they expected more but praised Judge Mokhine Mosopa for removing Ninow from society. “It’s child abuse, it cannot be tolerated. What Nicholas Ninow did is really a crime that cannot be forgiven,” said secretary Themba Masango. The National Prosecuting Authority also welcomed the sentence. The judge ordered that Ninow be included on the National Register for Sex Offenders and should never be employed at places where there were children. “The effect of this order is that in future, you cannot be employed in environments which involve children,” Judge Mosopa said. Ninow would begin serving his life sentence on Thursday tonight. WATCH: Child rapist Nicholas Ninow handed life sentence
