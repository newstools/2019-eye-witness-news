The former president will stand trial from Tuesday next week after the Pietermaritzburg High Court made the ruling on Friday. JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) said it was encouraged by Friday's High Court ruling dismissing Jacob Zuma's application for a permanent stay of prosecution. The former president will stand trial from Tuesday next week after the Pietermaritzburg High Court made the ruling on Friday.  Zuma is facing charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering linked to the multi-billion-rand arms deal.
