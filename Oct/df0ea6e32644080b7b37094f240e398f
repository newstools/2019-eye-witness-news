Despite the High Court in Johannesburg ordering Moyo's reinstatement, he has been prevented from returning to work. JOHANNESBURG - Axed Old Mutual CEO Peter Moyo has served the company with papers, seeking damages worth R250 million. Despite the High Court in Johannesburg ordering Moyo's reinstatement, he has been prevented from returning to work. The company is arguing that it is appealing the judgment. Old Mutual has indicated that it will defend the claim. Moyo's lawyer Eric Mabuza: "Mr Moyo issued a summons against Old Mutual which was delivered last week, on Friday. The type of relief that he seeks is permanent reinstatement. Alternatively, he seeks damages of about R250 million for breach of contract and delictual damages." Moyo was first suspended in May for an alleged conflict of interest and was fired a while later.
