This year's theme was "proudly African and authentically you", which has a different meaning for many here. "We decided we need to look beautiful. God made us this way and we just added extra glitter and brows and lashes," one participant said. Another added: "We're here and we're not going anywhere." Others used the event to call government to action. The event was not without controversy as it saw a smaller attendance, with some accusing organisers of being elitist and exclusionary.
