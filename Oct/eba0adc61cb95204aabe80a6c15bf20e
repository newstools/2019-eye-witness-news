But the protests spread, including complaints about living costs and social inequality. A general strike started on 23 October. Toll? 18 dead. LEBANON When? Since 17 October. Trigger? A proposed tax on calls made through messaging apps. State of play? The government of Saad Hariri quickly axed the measure and announced emergency economic reforms. But the protests have widened to demand the removal of the entire political class. Toll? Peaceful protests, marked by several clashes, have paralysed the country but there have been no injuries. GUINEA When? Since 7 October. Trigger? Accusations that President Alpha Conde is trying to circumvent a bar on a third term in office. State of play?

Toll? Eight killed and 1,340 injured. IRAQ When? Since 1 October. Trigger? Spontaneous calls on social media to protest corruption, unemployment and poor public services. State of play? After a week of protests that quickly escalated into clashes with security forces, the government announced reforms. Protesters continue to demand an end to corruption and unemployment, and an overhaul of the political system. On 25 October the protests resumed, with a new upsurge of violence, fanned by Shiite political leader Moqtada Sadr. Toll? More than 150 dead the first week. At least 12 on Friday alone. ONGOING MOVEMENTS Other protest movements, which started earlier this year, are continuing: After months of regular protests, including some of the worst violence the former British colony has known, the extradition bill was withdrawn in September. But the campaign had already broadened to demand greater democratic freedoms. Initially peaceful, the protests have degenerated into violent clashes between protesters and security forces. Numerous pro-democracy activists have been attacked by supporters of mainland China. On 1 October police shot a protestor with a live bullet but he survived. Bouteflika resigned in April but protesters continue to demand an overhaul of the entire political establishment. The opposition rejects elections under the current establishment, called for 12 December.
