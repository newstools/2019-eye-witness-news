He will make a return to Jonsson Kings Park as the Cell C Sharks tactical and technical kicking consultant. In a statement released on Monday, the Sharks confirmed that Lambie joined on a one-year contract and would work with contracted players across all of their professional teams. “As a player, Pat impressed with his natural ability and never-say-die attitude.
