JOHANNESBURG – The Guateng education department says its ready for the 2019 grade 12 senior certificate exams. MEC Panyaza Lesufi held a briefing a short while ago on the state of readiness for the upcoming matric exams.

One-thousand-and-seven centres are eligible to administer the 2019 examinations, across 15 districts in the province. Lesufi says 667 are public ordinary schools, 235 independent schools, 87 adult education and training centres, 11 correctional services centres and 7 designated centres. “An extensive network of monitors has been established across the province to assist all our monitors and to assist invigilators to know the new trends – but more importantly to monitor the and invigilate this examination in the proper format without invading the privacy of our learners.” He says teachers and pupils have signed a pledge to ensure that they don't participate in anything that will compromise the exams. The MEC says schools in the province have been performing well. “Just to reiterate our performance last year – none of our 15 districts in Gauteng performed below 80% – an indication that there is consistency and there is improvement of performance, especially in township schools where we have invested lots of resources." Quality assurance body Umalusi announced this week that despite challenges in some provinces, it is all systems go. Gauteng was the top performing province in 2018 with 87.9% pass rate.
