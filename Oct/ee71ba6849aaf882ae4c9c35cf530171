Golden Arrow's Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said: “It’s not uniformed, but undercover officers as well. So, you as a criminal don’t know if there is someone on the bus who is going to stop and search you and is going to arrest you if they need to.” One passenger said they were glad and felt much safer: “As you know the festive season is coming up and that’s the time when the robberies happen.”
