Stage 1 load shedding will be implemented from 9 am until 11 pm on Saturday. JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN - Eskom on Saturday said its technicians were working at the Medupi Power Station trying to fix coal-related problems that have resulted in load shedding for the last three days. Stage 1 load shedding will be implemented from 9 am until 11 pm on Saturday. The utility said a conveyer belt used to transport coal at the power station was malfunctioning and therefore load shedding was unavoidable. This week, the power utility started with blackouts citing severe pressure on its generating units. Eskom's Dikatso Mothae said: “We will be in a better position to advise in terms of the prognosis for tomorrow because the system is still quite constrained and volatile." Meanwhile, matrics affected by rolling blackouts in the Western Cape this week, are awaiting feedback on when they'll get to rewrite. On Wednesday, thirty-six centres were affected by power cuts when pupils did their CAT practical exam. Learners at five facilities were unable to finish their exams. The department's Bronagh Hammond said the learners would, unfortunately, have to rewrite their exams at a later stage. “We are collating the reports and will be sending them to DBE in terms of the next steps. In terms of the IT examinations which were held on Thursday, we are thankful that all 93 centres were able to write.” Click here to view your load shedding schedule.
