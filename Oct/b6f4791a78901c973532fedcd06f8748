BN  Mkhwebane said a number of her reports were taken to court and were at the receiving end of blistering attacks from ministers. She said this had a negative impact on her office’s finances. "Moreover owing to insufficient resources, my office cannot afford to have the remedial action we've taken enforced through the courts. As far as the affected parties are concerned, this renders this office somewhat toothless," Mkhwebane said. The Public Protector said her office needed an additional allocation of R110 million over the next three years. She pleaded with Parliament to allocate more funding to the Chapter Nine institution. "We continued to grapple with the issue of funding. Once again I look to the National Assembly to help us obtain a bigger slice of the budget," she said.
