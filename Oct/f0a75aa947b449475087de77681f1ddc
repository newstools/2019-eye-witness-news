On Tuesday, dozens of minibus taxis blocked the area around the station deck. Their grievances related to traffic enforcement and permit issues. CAPE TOWN - Minibus taxis are now blocking the N2 highway at the M5. This means heavy delays leaving the city. Earlier, Nelson Mandela Boulevard inbound was blocked at Searle Street and taxis were blocking roads within the CBD. Traffic services Maxine Bezuidenhout: "Sir Lowry Road is closed in both directions between Russell Street and Tennant Street. We also have Christiaan Barnard closed in both directions between Hertzog Boulevard and Tennant Street. Motorists are advised to avoid that section of the CBD and utilise alternative routes out of the city this afternoon." Meanwhile, Golden Arrow Bus Services' Bronwen Dyke Beyer said that its operations were also affected. "A number of roads are closed and are blocked in the vicinity of the Golden Acre. At this stage, we are operating but with diversions. if you are at the Golden Acre please approach an official for updates as the situation is changing quickly." The protest follows Tuesday's action when dozens of minibus taxis blocked the area around the station deck. Their grievances related to traffic enforcement and permit issues.
