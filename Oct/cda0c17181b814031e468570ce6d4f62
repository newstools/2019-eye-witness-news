However, local fans have reacted to a video on social media of him attempting to approach a group hug with involving the likes of Frans Steyn but then turning back.  The winger spoke out after the game, explaining that “in the team there is a bomb squad and those are players who come from the bench and drafted into the playing side” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “They have their own calls and own spirit that they refer to themselves as, the bomb squad,” he added. “As you saw yesterday, after a game, we normally shake hands with our opponents and all the players but at that time the bomb squad was gathered together and were busy with their own call. I was just walking and greeting people and I saw that the bomb squad was busy with their call and I realised I am not involved in it and I went back, as you see in the video. Otherwise there is nothing wrong, we are one”.
