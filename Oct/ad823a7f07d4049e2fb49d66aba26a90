CHIBA, Japan - Tiger Woods won the Zozo Championship by three strokes on Monday, matching Sam Sneadâ€™s record of 82 PGA Tour victories. It was not exactly smooth sailing for Woods, but in the end his closing three-under-par 67 was enough to hold off a challenge from Hideki Matsuyama at Narashino Country Club in the first PGA Tour event played in Japan.
