The South African currency rallied from near R15.00 to a session-best R14.77 on Thursday, ending a losing streak triggered by state power utility Eskom’s resumption on Wednesday of nationwide controlled blackouts. JOHANNESBURG - The rand firmed on Friday, building on gains made after the government released a long-delayed plan for electricity generation to address crippling power cuts. At 1620 GMT, the rand was up 0.3% at R14.7900 per US dollar. The South African currency rallied from near R15.00 to a session-best R14.77 on Thursday, ending a losing streak triggered by state power utility Eskom’s resumption on Wednesday of nationwide controlled blackouts. Eskom has blamed unforeseen breakdowns at some of its coal-burning plants, but analysts say they are a symptom of mismanagement over many years, which has seen it sink into roughly R440 billion ($30 billion) of debt. The release of the new electricity generation plan, replacing a previous blueprint not updated for almost a decade, gave investors a degree of policy certainty, but Eskom still does not have a permanent chief executive.
