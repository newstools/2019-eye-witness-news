Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe has been denied leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. JOHANNESBURG - Fees Must Fall activist Kanya Cekeshe has been denied leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. His application for bail has also been dismissed. In 2017, Cekeshe was sentenced to eight years in jail - with three years suspended - for malicious damage to property after he was found guilty of setting alight a police vehicle during Fees Must Fall protests. His lawyers have argued that there was insufficient evidence against him despite his conviction. Cekeshe approached the Johannesburg Magistrates Court in an attempt to be released on bail pending his appeal. “At no stage during the trial for application for leave to appeal against the sentence, did the applicant hint he was not satisfied with the conduct of his lawyer. The contention that the applicant did not have a fair trial because of the incompetence of his legal representative is unfounded,” the judge said. Cekeshe's lawyer, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, had argued that the lawyer who represented him in his trial was inexperienced and incompetent and that there was insufficient evidence against him despite his conviction.
