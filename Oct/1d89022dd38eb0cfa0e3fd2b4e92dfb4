They forced their way into the stadium, attacked other spectators and destroyed equipment belonging to several broadcast companies, causing damage amounting to R2.6 million. 7 of the 9 Kaizer Chiefs supporters who wreaked havoc to the tune of the R2,6m and caused several injuries to others at the Moses Mabhida stadium last year have come face to face with some of the victims to tender their apologies. @NkoRaphael pic.twitter.com/RX6fuSn4bZ  The victims accepted the apologies at a victim-offender mediation facilitated by the Correctional Services Department. It was an emotional session at the stadium as victims recounted the violence on that day in April last year. Sabelo Mazibuko, who was one of the victims, said he suffered permanent injuries to his back. “That day completely changed how I live life. My health has improved a bit, but my body still hurts.” One of the perpetrators, John Khumalo, said he acted under the influence of alcohol, but he had learnt his lesson. “I’m now one of those people who have a criminal record. I’m very sorry to South African football lovers and families.” eThekwini Deputy Mayor Belinda Scott called on Kaizer Chiefs management to encourage their supporters to behave better. Club spokesperson Vino Maphosa said they would intensify their supporter training programmes.
