Numsa wanted its members to strike over the withdrawal of anniversary bonuses by management.

Flights that may be affected are SAA, SA Express, SA Airlink, Mango and Swiss Airlines. Hlubi-Majola said they would not back down until their demands were met. "Instead of engaging with us, they rushed to court in order to silence our members. We'll do everything in our power to ensure workers are able to exercise their right to strike. Aluta continua!‚Äù
