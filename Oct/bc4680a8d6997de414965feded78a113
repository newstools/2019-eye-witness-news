The former president faces charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering linked to the multi-billion rand arms deal. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma will file an application for leave to appeal a High Court judgment that dismissed his application for a permanent stay of public prosecution in his corruption case. The former president faces charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering linked to the multi-billion rand arms deal. He was briefly back in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday morning where his legal team told the judge that they will appeal Friday’s judgment. The National Prosecuting Authority said it would oppose the application, adding that it was convinced there were no reasonable prospects of success. Prosecutor Billy Downer said: “The State is really serious in getting this trial running as soon as practically possible, which is at the earliest date possible date next year.” On Friday, a full bench of judges dismissed his application for a permanent stay of prosecution, saying he failed to prove to the court that there were no reasonable and probable grounds for his successful prosecution. He previously argued for the case to be struck off the roll, saying the charges were politically motivated and that the unreasonable delays in prosecuting him have prejudiced him. The matter has been postponed to 4 February 2020.  NPA OPPOSES APPLICATION The NPA said it would oppose the application, adding that it’s convinced there are no reasonable prospects of success. “The state is really serious about getting this trial running as soon as possible. The court can accommodate us from April. The date will be determined as we go forward,” said prosecutor Billy Downer. Despite puma’s plan to appeal his lawyer advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi said the former president had been prepared for his trial for a long time. “Mr Zuma has been ready to face this trial for over 14 years.” The matter has been postponed to 4 February next year.
