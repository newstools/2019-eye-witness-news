CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) said it would ensure a Mitchells Plain school beefs up security after a guard was killed over the weekend.

Education MEC spokesperson Jessica Shelver said two security cameras were stolen. “We are deeply saddened by the alleged murder of a security guard at Woodlands Secondary School. It is extremely concerning that this has happened on the school premises.” In March, police confiscated weapons, dagga, cigarettes and handcuffs during a search and seizure operation at Woodlands Secondary School.
