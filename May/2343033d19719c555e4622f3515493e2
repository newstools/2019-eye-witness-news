CAPE TOWN - Rob Packham  has been found guilty of the murder of his wife Gill Packham as well as a charge of defeating or obstructing the administration of justice. The Constantia businessman was arrested shortly after Gill Packham’s body was found in the boot of her burnt-out BMW at the Diep River train station in February 2018. The couple had been dealing with marital problems and were seeing a counsellor at the time of the murder. Throughout the trial Packham maintained his innocence, disputing witness testimony placing him near the crime scene and another account claiming he was driving his wife's car on the day of her disappearance. During the trial, prosecutor Susan Galloway argued that Packham killed his wife, disposed of the murder weapon, placed her body in the boot of her car and set it alight after finding himself in a tight spot with two women in his life - his wife and his mistress. But advocate Craig Webster said Packham was a favourable witness who was consistent with his evidence from the early stages of the investigation and should be acquitted. Webster said the investigating officer had his sights set on Packham since the beginning and built a case only around the accused, seeking to mislead the court during his testimony.
