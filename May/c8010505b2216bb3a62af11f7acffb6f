JOHANNESBURG - Retired former Absa Premiership player of the season Siyabonga Nomvete has picked Orlando Pirates playmaker Thembinkosi Lorch to win the coveted player of the season award at the awards ceremony in Durban at the weekend. Nomvete was speaking at the announcement of the nominees in Durban on Monday morning where Lorch was nominated in three top categories, including player’s player of the year and midfielder of the year alongside the Mamelodi Sundowns duo of Themba Zwane and Hlompho Kekana. “I think Thembinkosi Lorch should win the player of the season award. He did very well ever since he started the season with the way he performed - going forward, scoring goals - and deserves to win this award.” The 41-year-old Nomvete played his last game in a 25-year-long career when Amazulu went down 3-1 to Bloemfontein Celtic at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in East London this past weekend. Lorch will have to fight off Mamelodi Sundowns' Zwane and captain Kekana in all three categories, while in the cup competitions Lorch will have to fend off stiff competition from Telkom Knockout winners Baroka FC's duo of Elvis Chipezeze and Mduduzi Mdantsane for the player of the tournament award. Pitso Mosimane, Micho Sredojevic and Benni McCarthy will go head to head for the coach of the season award with Mosimane favoured to take home the accolade for leading the Brazilians to consecutive Absa Premiership titles and a record ninth league title.
