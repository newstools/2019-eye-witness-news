Without giving specific details, the African National Congress said Mabuza was sworn in on Tuesday because he was satisfied his name had been cleared. PRETORIA - African National Congress (ANC) ANC deputy president David Mabuza has been sworn in as a member of Parliament at the presidential guesthouse. “I, Dabede David Mabuza, swear that I will be faithful to the Republic of South Africa and will obey, respect and uphold the Constitution and all other laws of the republic,” Mabuza declared before Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. "And I solemnly promise to perform my function in the National Assembly to the best of my ability,” he said. Last week Mabuza postponed his swearing in, saying he wanted to first clear his name after the party’s integrity commission recommended that he and other ANC members be removed from the party’s candidate list to Parliament over various offences. The commission is still carrying out its work - currently convening sittings to meet with the 22 flagged members before a final report is presented to the national executive committee at the end of this week. After postponing his swearing in last week, Mabuza met with the integrity commission on Friday on the eve of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s inauguration. The question now is, will he also be sworn in as a member of the executive when Ramaphosa announces his Cabinet later this week? After being sworn in on Tuesday, the president shook his hand and jubilantly proclaimed, “Ses' phelele manje (We are all here now)."
