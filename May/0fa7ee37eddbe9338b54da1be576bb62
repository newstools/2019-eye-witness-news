JOHANNESBURG - Former President Jacob Zuma has thrown his weight behind controversial eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede. In a tweet posted on Sunday night, Zuma said he hoped the corruption charges against Gumede were not politically motivated like his. Zuma said he would continue to support the mayor. Gumedeâ€™s charges relate to a 2016 Durban solid waste removal tender, which reportedly cost the city over R200 million for services not rendered. She is currently out on bail  after appearing in court last week. I shall show Comrade Zandile Gumede the same support that she has shown me for the past decade. Be strong my Leader, this too shall pass.  (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
