JOHANNESBURG – Lenasia South residents are threatening a shut down next week over land grabs. Angry residents blocked roads a few days ago, demanding to speak to Gauteng Human Settlement MEC Uhuru Moiloa about land invasions in their area. It’s understood a group of people continue to occupy land there illegally, despite several warnings against this and evictions. The Lenasia South Residents Association's Joy Govender said: “As a community, we’ve decided should they do that, we can’t get hold of JMPD or any officials late at night. We then took a stand upon ourselves.”
