JOHANNESBURG - Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) president Mangosuthu Buthelezi says the country has never had a free and fair election, even after the country became a democracy. The IFP told journalists during a post-election briefing in KwaZulu-Natal that it had always been open about the credibility of the country's elections.

Buthelezi said he agreed with the smaller parties. “From 1994, I’ve always been seen as a spoiler; I’ve been very candid that we’ve never had a free and fair election in South Africa. Even if my party didn’t do badly, I certainly agree with the smaller parties that it wasn’t a free and fair election.”  (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
