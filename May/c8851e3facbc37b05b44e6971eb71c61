The Presidency released a statement on Sunday afternoon saying it noted media reports that the announcement will be made on Monday, 27 May and said it will only be announced later in the week. JOHANNESBURG - The Office of the Presidency has said the cabinet announcement will be made later in the week. In a statement released on Sunday, the Presidency dismissed media reports that the announcement will be made on Monday, 27 May. It did not give a certain date for the announcement. "The Constitution of the Republic stipulates that the President must assume office within five days of being elected by the National Assembly â€“ and thereafter appoint a Cabinet and assign its powers and functions," the statement said. "President Cyril Ramaphosa is emphatic that the new executive must possess requisite skills, experience, representativity and a commitment to the public services that will take the work of the sixth administration forward." There has been speculation over who will make the cut to Ramaphosa's first cabinet as democratically elected president and whether he will reduce the number of departments which currently sits at 35. Economic Freedom Fighters leader, Julius Malema, said on Saturday that if Ramaphosa appoints out-going Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, he will be a constitutional delinquent and that if he doesn't appoint David Mabuza as Deputy President, he would be digging his own grave. Trade union Cosatu has said the president consulted with it about the composition of his new cabinet, adding that it urged him to appoint individuals who are competent and those who have performed well in the past. Some days ago, Ramaphosa said he will pick men and women in his Cabinet who will help achieve his goal to grow the economy.
