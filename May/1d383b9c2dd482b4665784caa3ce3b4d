If you say you can’t be led by women, you are saying you can’t be led by Winnie Mandela.” He also called out men who commit gender-based violence and said women will own more than 50% of land when government comes into power. “Anyone that goes around perpetuating violence against women, they need to talk to themselves. We are all human beings. Under the EFF government will own more than 50% of the land because they are the majority in South Africa.”
