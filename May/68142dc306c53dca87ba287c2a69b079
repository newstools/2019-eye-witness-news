Seven patients were transported to the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital, two of them in a critical condition. Acting hospital CEO Michael Malaka said that a woman succumbed to her injuries last night. "It was a female patient that arrived at 3.30pm with head injuries and a blunt abdominal injury. The patient was booked for theatre and later died in theatre, unfortunately."
