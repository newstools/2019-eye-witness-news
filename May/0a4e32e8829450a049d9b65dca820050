Maimane was addressing supporters at Soweto’s partly-filled Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday as part of the party’s final rally before the 8 May elections. DOBSONVILLE – Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has attacked the African National Congress (ANC)’s service delivery record, saying a vote for President Cyril Ramaphosa  is a vote for corruption. Maimane was addressing supporters at Soweto’s partly-filled Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday as part of the party’s final rally before the 8 May elections. Maimane started his speech off with a sweeping statement and said: “This is our moment in history. It is now or never.” He said the DA has changed for the better and is a government in waiting. Maimane also had a message for those planning to vote for the ANC because they liked Ramaphosa. He said: “If you vote for that man you are voting for corruption. You are telling people yes, steal from us for the next five years.” Recently-published opinion polls predict that the DA’s support would remain relatively stable, but Maimane said the party will prove these wrong and grow. BE BRAVE LIKE CASTER SEMENYA Maimane told South Africans to be brave like Caster Semenya. This week, the International Association of Athletics Federations told the South African Olympic gold medalist that she had to medically lower her testosterone levels to continue competing in the 800 metres. Maimane said she's had to put up with unimaginable humiliation and suffering but had remained strong. He said Semenya’s bravery will change history.
