There was a 68% voter turnout of over 6 million registered to vote in the province. JOHANNESBURG - With vote counting in Gauteng now 100% completed, the African National Congress (ANC) has just managed to retain dominance at 50.19% of the votes in the hotly contested province, with the Democratic Alliance (DA) at 27.45% and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) at 14.69%. There was a 68% voter turnout of over 6 million registered to vote in the province. More than 37,000 votes cast in Gauteng were declared spoilt votes. The ANC in Gauteng said it was backing premier David Makhura to retain the position in the province. The party’s Gauteng deputy chairperson Panyaza Lesufi said Makhura had done well and should be given another term to serve as premier. He was speaking at Gauteng Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) Results Centre in Auckland Park after the completion of all votes counted, giving the ANC a marginal victory. Lesufi said his name would not be on the list of candidates for the position of premier in the province. He said there was no need for the party to field new players, at the moment. “Our premier candidate remains David Makhura, but you know it’s not our call as the province, it’s up to the NEC. And when the NEC makes that decision, we’ll respect it.” He expressed gratitude to everyone who showed trust in the party by voting despite challenges facing the organisation. Lesufi said the party would work harder going forward. Top 10 parties in Gauteng: ANC 50.19% DA 27.45% EFF 14.69% VF PLUS 3.56% IFP 0.89% ACDP 0.71% ATM 0.25% PAC 0.24% COPE 0.24% UDM 0.21%
