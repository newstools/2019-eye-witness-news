The Women's League threw its weight behind Magashule and other ANC members implicated in allegations of corruptions such Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane. JOHANNESBURG - A commemoration of the life and times of the late Walter Sisulu is currently underway in the Free State. Thousands have gathered the Waaihoek Methodist Church for the late struggle stalwart's memorial lecture. Former Free State Premier and African National Congress secretary-general Ace Magushule delivered the keynote address.  Alliance partners and the ANC Youth and Women's League gave their messages of support. The Women's League threw its weight behind Magashule and other ANC members implicated in allegations of corruptions such Bathabile Dlamini and Nomvula Mokonyane. The ANC Youth League's Makalo Mohale said: “We want to remind people that the process of empowering black people is still far. So, the process of radical economic transformation must happen in the sixth administration which is under the governance of the African National Congress.” MAGASHULE: NEVER SING ABOUT LEADERS WHO ARE STILL ALIVE Magushule cautioned members of the party against singing songs praising leaders who are still alive. He said such praises gave some leaders the impression that they are bigger than the liberation movement. Magashule said leaders who were still alive shouldn't be glorified in song: “Never sing songs about leaders who are still alive because they are going to think that they are special and important because they are promoted by the media. They think that they are more important than the ANC itself.” There was a war of words between Magashule and the ANC’s head of elections Fikile Mbalula last week after the secretary-general challenged the view that it is was Cyril Ramaphosa who led the ANC's 2019 electoral success.
