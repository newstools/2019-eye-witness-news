Two wards became vacant after the Port Elizabeth High Court ruled in December last year that they needed to be contested. CAPE TOWN â€“ The general elections are barely a week old and a by-election will be held in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday. The newly-formed Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party will join the African National Congress (ANC), Democratic Alliance, African Christian Democratic Party, and Patriotic Alliance, in contesting by-elections in Nelson Mandela Bay's northern areas. Two wards became vacant after the Port Elizabeth High Court ruled in December last year that they needed to be contested. This after two former DA councillors joined the ANC. Both wards are DA strongholds.
