Parts of Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane have been hit with water restrictions. JOHANNESBURG - Rand Water said that while water levels were still sitting below 60%, its reservoirs were gradually improving. Parts of Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane have been hit with water restrictions. That left some residents and businesses frustrated, claiming they were not informed about the restrictions which Rand Water implemented on Friday due to a shortage in capacity. Spokesperson Justice Mohale said high lying areas would be hardest hit. “We’re trying to prevent a situation where people would not have water for quite a long time. We say it’s better to implement this and people here and there don’t have water than to let the situation worsen.”
