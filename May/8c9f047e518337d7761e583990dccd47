Magashule paid a courtesy visit to iNkosi Mthethwa. KwaMthethwa chief Mthethwa said his village needed a tarred road, tractors for farming and fencing, and Magashule said he would report to the government to assist. “There is land... they don’t have equipment, but I was saying that is what the government is supposed to do. I will report to the president [Cyril Ramaphosa].”  But he was quick to point out that he was not buying votes. “It’s too late, it is six days before elections. We don’t want people to say we are buying votes, but our people need these things now.” The ANC issued a statement saying former President Jacob Zuma would join Magashule on the campaign trail.
