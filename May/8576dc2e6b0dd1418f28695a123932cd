Madibeng has been identified as one of the hotspots where trouble could occur on this election day but it’s been calm in the municipality, with no incidents reported. At the polling station in the Makhudu Levy Mamabolo community hall in Oukasie, election officials say everything is on track to open on time.    A voter said that protesters should rather come out to make their mark today. “I think they must come and cast their vote because every vote is their secret. So maybe the place can improve, they can get service delivery, water, RDPs, the road.” Some police cars were spotted patrolling the streets, but their presence was fairly low-key. The African National Congress fired the mayor, Jostina Mothibe, last week after severe infighting led to the appointment of two municipal managers. WATCH: Quiet start to elections in North West
