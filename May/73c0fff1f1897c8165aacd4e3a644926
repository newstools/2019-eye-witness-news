At 0605 GMT, the rand traded at R14.2100 per dollar, 0.26% weaker than its New York close on Friday. South African markets strengthened on Friday on expectations of political continuity, as the governing African National Congress (ANC) headed for a national election victory. “In spite of last week’s election and a perceived investor-friendly outcome, the rand has been largely driven by international factors with the election contributing only marginally to its direction,” Peregrine Treasury Solutions Corporate Treasury Manager Bianca Botes said. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark instrument due in 2026 fell 1.5 basis points to 8.445% in early trade.
