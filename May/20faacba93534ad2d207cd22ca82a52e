Newly elected Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has named his Cabinet. CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape has a new provincial Cabinet. Premier Alan Winde unveiled his Cabinet on Thursday morning following his election on Wednesday. Winde said his department would house an economic war room to work together with his new Cabinet. The war room unit would be tasked with growing business and investment. He was set on creating more jobs and growing the provincial economy, he said. He and the members of his cabinet would ensure they "meet our jobs, safety and public transport pledges by agreeing with the ministers attached to these portfolios; that I receive regular detailed reports on our progress in achieving these goals". Winde said the first order of business would be to proactively look into the severe bureaucratic challenges facing the private sector. He said red tape was one of the challenges blocking opportunities and jobs growth. Former transport and public works MEC Donald Grant would serve as an adviser in Winde's office with the mandate to execute the provincial government's public transport pledge. Winde's first Cabinet has three new faces. Former speaker of the provincial legislature Sharna Fernandez is the new MEC for social development. Tertius Simmers will take over as human settlements MEC from Bonginkosi Madikizela who's been given the transport and public works portfolio. Albert Fritz has been shifted to community safety. Former MP David Maynier is the new finance and economic opportunities MEC. Former finance MEC Ivan Meyer has been moved to agriculture. Debbie Schafer remains in the education portfolio and Nomafrench Mbombo remains the province's health MEC. Anton Bredell remains in local government and development planning, while Anroux Marais keeps her job as MEC for sport and recreation. Winde also wanted to drive innovation to attract the right skills to the provincial government.
