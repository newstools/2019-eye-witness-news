The area had been a hotspot for land grabs with Lenasia residents last week threatening to shut down the area in protest against illegal land occupation. JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) said they're investigating two incidents of land grabs in Lenasia and Wimbledon, south of Johannesburg. The area had been a hotspot for land grabs with Lenasia residents last week threatening to shut down the area in protest against illegal land occupation. The JMPD's Wayne Minnaar said officers are monitoring the area: “There have been a few reports of illegal land invasions. One in Extension 9 and in Wimbledon and officers have been sent to investigate what is happening.” Meanwhile, Lenasia residents criticised government for not doing enough to curb land grabs. Lenasia Civic Association’s Joy Govender said: “So, how can government now sit and pretend like nothing is happening when we are reporting it every single day. We have spoken to different people and nothing is being done.”
