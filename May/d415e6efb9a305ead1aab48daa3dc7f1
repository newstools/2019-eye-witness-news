SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA â€“ Samantha Mewis scored once in each half and Carli Lloyd added a late goal as the United States dominated South Africa 3-0 on Sunday in a Women's World Cup tune-up. The victory at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, launched the Americans' "Send-Off Series" of matches as they prepare to defend their title at the World Cup in France, which begins on 7 June. Mewis opened the scoring in the 37th minute, finishing with a low shot inside the right post after Rose Lavelle slipped a ball into the top of the penalty area.  Mewis struck again in the second half, after South African keeper Kaylin Swart's deflection of a cross from Megan Rapinoe wasn't enough to keep the ball from a charging Mewis, who slotted it into the back of the net. Lloyd buried an injury-time strike through three South African players to notch her 108th international goal.
