The ANC has been on a steady decline in Gauteng since 2004. In 2014, the liberation movement only managed to obtain just over 53%. JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) said that opposition parties shouldn't celebrate just yet after the party officially dipped below the 50% mark in Gauteng. While the ANC looked like it may not be able to obtain over 50% in South Africa's economic hub, the party's Ezra Letsoalo was adamant that they may just surprise opposition parties. The ANC has been on a steady decline in Gauteng since 2004. In 2014, the liberation movement only managed to obtain just over 53%. The party was currently sitting at 49.6%. It needs over 50% to get itself out of the coalition territory. About 59% of the votes have been tallied in Gauteng so far, so it remains to be seen whether the ANC will secure a majority. ANC head of the presidency Zizi Kodwa added that votes from their strongholds are yet to be counted. “Across provinces, the ANC is growing. About 700 readings are yet to come from Gauteng. We are confident that the metros that are outstanding [we will do well] because people can see the work of the African National Congress.” The Democratic Alliance, which was hoping to make a run for the province, is trailing far behind at 28.38% followed by the Economic Freedom Fighters at 13.94%. The fourth party is the Freedom Front Plus, with just about 4% of the vote.
