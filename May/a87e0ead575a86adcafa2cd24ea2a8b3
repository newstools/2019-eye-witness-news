South Africa’s No.2 insurer Old Mutual Ltd said on Friday chief executive Peter Moyo had been suspended following a “material breakdown in trust” between him and the board. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s number two insurer Old Mutual Ltd said on Friday chief executive Peter Moyo had been suspended following a “material breakdown in trust” between him and the board. “As a result, the board has suspended the Chief Executive Officer with immediate effect,” the company said in a statement, adding that chief operating officer Iain Williamson would assume the role of acting CEO. A spokesperson for the company said Old Mutual chairperson Trevor Manuel would provide more information at the insurer’s Annual General Meeting on Friday afternoon. Moyo did not respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn. Moyo’s suspension comes just under a year after the listing of Old Mutual Ltd following the disentangling of the 173-year-old group’s conglomerate structure last year. The break-up, set in motion in 2016, split the group into a US asset manager, British wealth manager, Old Mutual Ltd and a South African bank. Moyo, who has held senior executive or board positions in a variety of big and state-owned firms, rejoined the group in June 2017, initially as head of its emerging markets division prior to the break-up. He had previously served as deputy managing director of Old Mutual, before leaving in 2005 to head up financial services group Alexander Forbes.
