This motion will be considered in council on Thursday afternoon. CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance's Western Cape leadership is fully supporting its Knysna caucus in its plan to get rid of the town's mayor. The party's Federal Executive has approved a caucus request to table a motion of no confidence against Mark Willemse at Thursday's council meeting. Another big item on the agenda is the budget, which Willemse says should be council's main focus. In a statement, DA provincial leader Bonginkosi Madikizela said that Willemse was accepted and elected as Knysna mayor by a majority of the ANC councillors. That election followed Willemse and fellow DA councillor Peter Myers' decision to side with opposition parties in a motion of no confidence in former mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies. Willemse was then elected mayor and Madikizela said that he's being kept in office by the ANC. Madikizela said he expected the ANC to also support Willemse in today's no-confidence motion, which he believes effectively makes him an ANC mayor. Seven of the nine DA councillors in Knysna have asked Willemse to resign, accusing him of lacking political leadership and ignoring ideas from his caucus.
