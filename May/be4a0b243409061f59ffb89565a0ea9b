While the ANC was singing a song of unity, divisions within the party played themselves out on Twitter as senior officials lashed out at each other. JOHANNESBURG - A political analyst says the confrontation between  Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus and African National Congress (ANC) head of elections Fikile Mbalula that played out on social media on Wednesday showed that the ruling party hadn't learnt its lesson. Political analyst Sanusha Naidoo said the leaders were enforcing factionalism in the party, instead of building the organisation. ‚ÄúPeople see this as continuing to increase the distrust of the party, and the level of institutional trust as well is diminishing. "There should be decorum... they haven‚Äôt learnt the lesson yet.‚Äù While the ANC has been singing a song of unity, divisions within the party were evident on Twitter on Wednesday as the senior officials lashed out at each other. Niehaus had weighed in after ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule dismissed Mbalula‚Äôs claim that the party‚Äôs decision to elect Cyril Ramaphosa as president prevented what would have been an even worse result in the elections. Niehaus accused Mbalula of not respecting his seniors, Magashule in particular. Niehaus said Mbalula blocked him, fearing engagement about what he called ‚Äúhis blatant opportunism and careerism‚Äù. Mbalula hit back, describing Niehaus as a crook, adding that his presence at Luthuli House was a mystery. Another senior member, Derek Hanekom, urged Niehaus to clarify several questionable statements he has made, including whether his mother was still alive. Hmmm so this young chap, Mr. Fearfokkol üôÑ, @MbalulaFikile, has gone & blocked me. He seems to fear much, especially engagement about his blatant opportunism, careerism & lack of repect for his seniors, such as the SG of the ANC, comrade @Magashule_Ace. Talk about real cowardice! pic.twitter.com/q1SB8GMIrz  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
