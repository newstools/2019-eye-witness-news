President Cyril Ramaphosa is under pressure to pick ministers untainted by scandal for a slimmed-down Cabinet, its size hinging on the extent to which government departments will be reconfigured for a leaner, more efficient administration.

Ramaphosa is set to be sworn in as the country’s president on Wednesday afternoon. He addressed the first meeting of the African National Congress (ANC)’s parliamentary caucus on Tuesday and spoke to journalists briefly afterwards. Asked if he’d been losing sleep over the composition of his new Cabinet, Ramaphosa hinted that final decisions must yet be made. “No, it’s not sleepless nights, it’s the work that we’ve got to do and everybody knows that we’ve got to do this work and that’s precisely what we’re working on now.” Ramaphosa is under pressure to pick ministers untainted by scandal for a slimmed-down Cabinet, its size hinging on the extent to which government departments will be reconfigured for a leaner, more efficient administration. “We’ll present an outcome that I think the country will welcome and will be pleased with - because it will have a very good balance of gender, youth, competence, demographic [and] regional spread and all that. So wait and see, watch this space.” (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
