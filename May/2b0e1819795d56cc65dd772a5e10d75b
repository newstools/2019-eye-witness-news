President Cyril Ramaphosa campaigned in Mitchells Plain, where he told residents the government would make communities safer. CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday since the establishment of the Anti-Gang Unit, gang activity in Cape Town had dropped by 24%. The president officially launched the initiative in November 2018. He campaigned in Mitchells Plain, where he told residents the government would make communities safer and that the Anti-Gang Unit would be bolstered in the Western Cape and Gauteng. He said Western Cape's biggest social ills were crime and drugs. “Since we established it [Anti-Gang Unit], gang violence and gang activity have gone down by 24%. We want to put them [gangsters] behind bars.” Mitchells Plain resident Michael Jacobs said the gang-unit alone won’t help, he told the president the community would help police. “We support the Anti-Gang Unit; however, it needs to be bolstered.” #SAElections2019 The President has arrived CA pic.twitter.com/8TMqKVpNDe  (Edited by Zamangwane Shange)
