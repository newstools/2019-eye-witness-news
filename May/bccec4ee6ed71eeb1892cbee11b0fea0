Zille was speaking at the Democratic Alliance's Workers' Day rally at Hillsong Church in Century City.

Zille told cheering supporters to go all out to prevent a coalition between the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) from prevailing come voting day next Wednesday. That would bring an end to the DA‚Äôs past decade in charge in the Western Cape. ‚ÄúStay true to the blue, because there‚Äôs only one party that can bring people together.‚Äù The DA‚Äôs candidate for premier, Alan Winde, and party leader Mmusi Maimane also addressed the crowd. #WorkerDay DA Western Cape Premier Candidate, Alan Winde takes the stage.

The DA is not discounting the possibility of a coalition between the ANC and the EFF snatching control of the province after 8 May. Winde was speaking to Eyewitness News after addressing the party‚Äôs Workers‚Äô Day rally. He said while it (Western Cape) was the best-governed province in the country, it would follow ANC-led provinces into failure if the party did not hold its majority come voting day. He said the polls showed the Western Cape could see a coalition coming to power in the province, which could go the way of the ANC and the EFF. ‚ÄúThat knife edge means that we've got to get every single vote that we can and make sure that people don‚Äôt stray off to other smaller parties. We‚Äôve got to make sure that we keep this province in the interests of what we‚Äôve built in the last 10 years.‚Äù A failure to achieve an outright majority could also see the DA trying to cobble together a ruling coalition in the province.
