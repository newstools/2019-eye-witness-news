The 29-year-old man committed suicide after allegedly killing the three children aged two, three and 11 at his house in Block W, Soshanguve. SOSHANGUVE - The mother of the three children who were killed on Tuesday in Soshanguve said she was on her way to court to obtain a protection order against the man who allegedly murdered them when she got news of their deaths. The 29-year-old man committed suicide after allegedly killing the three children aged two, three and 11 at his house in Block W, Soshanguve. He was the father of the two-year-old, and a stepfather to the other two children. The mother said she had not reported him to the police for abuse sooner because she thought he would change. She said police were also looking for him in connection with a rape case. The grieving mother said she broke up with the man in April, but he wouldn’t accept the end of their relationship, so she sought a protection order against him. “Before everything happened, we used to fight all the time. I ended up telling him it’s over, even his sister knew that he used to hit me,” the mother said. She said she only reported his violent behaviour to his parents but never to the police.  The 27-year-old woman said she regretted allowing his ex-boyfriend access to her children. She said the man, who was a taxi driver, transported the three to crèche and school every morning. She said she received a call from him before the incident. “He then gave the phone to my first- and second-born to tell me that they loved me and then took the phone to tell me that he loved me. I quickly asked the police to go to his house. When they got there he had already killed the children and taken his own life,” she said. The three children will be buried this weekend and the man the following weekend.  (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
