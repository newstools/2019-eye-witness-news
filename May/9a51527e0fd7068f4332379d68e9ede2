Some voters in Soweto could not make their mark because of a misunderstanding over whether Monday’s special vote was for home visits and if walk-ins were allowed. SOWETO - Voting has got off to a shaky start in Soweto because of a misunderstanding over whether Monday’s vote was for home visits and if walk-ins were allowed. Khuthala Primary School in Soweto was one of the stations opened for special voting on Monday. Science and Technology Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane was at the school to cast her vote. However, when voting started some voters, including the minister, could not make their mark because of the misunderstanding over the voting process. They were eventually allowed to vote later. “They were not available to make us vote here," she said. "They said they don’t accept walk-ins, which we found very strange because we understand that special votes are about those at home and it’s also about the voting station. So, I anticipated to come and vote earlier and was told they are not doing that." Once that was resolved, at least one voter was still turned back. “I really wanted to vote. I’m in pain now, I have a sore leg, but I still came to vote,” said the disappointed resident. "Imagine, how am I going to vote on Wednesday?" The centre is expected to remain open until 5pm.
