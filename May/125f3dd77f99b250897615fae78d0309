IEC deputy CEO Masego Shiburi said the commission was highly satisfied with voting progress, however, there were some setbacks including those caused by protests. JOHANNESBURG – The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has confirmed that at least five voting stations had not yet opened by 5 pm on Wednesday. IEC deputy CEO Masego Shiburi made the announcement while South Africans citizens across the country were still casting their votes. “Despite the best efforts of the security agencies, government representatives and the Commission, five voting stations had still not opened by 5 pm.” These were one station in Buffalo City and one in Ntabankulu, in the Eastern Cape, and three voting stations in Inkosi Langalibalele municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. He said the commission was so far highly satisfied with voting progress. However, there were some setbacks, including those caused by protests. “Efforts to resolve these and provide voters in these areas with an opportunity to exercise their democratic right to vote are continuing and will continue for as long as is necessary. No voters who are on the queue by 9 pm will be turned away and voting will continue at those stations until everyone in the queue had been served.” At the same time, Shiburi said four other stations in Vuwani, Limpopo, were forced to close for safety reasons but were later reopened. "The commission is saddened by the lack of respect for democracy and the rights of others in these limited areas and once again calls on these communities to put the national interests of the country above the narrow interests of the community at least for today." The shortage of ballot papers was among issues experienced at voting stations, with Shiburi adding that that issue was 'rapidly resolved'.
