Meanwhile, City maintains their good run when playing at home having not lost in 11 matches and stay in the top four. Cityâ€™s high press worked wonders from the first whistle as Craig Martin won the ball from Innocent Maela and then squared it into a dangerous area which Siphelele Mthembu got them on the end of but midfielder Zuki Kewuti finished up from close range, City had led after 22 seconds. This was a small indicator of the type of match it would as both sides came out with an offensive mindset. After resisting the early City pressure, the potential Absa Premiership winners equaliser through the excellent Thembinkosi Lorch who made no mistake with a neat left finish. The teams are locked at 1-1 at the half-time break but this was before both sides had their fair share of goal scoring chances. Pirates, in particular, grew into the match as it progressed.
