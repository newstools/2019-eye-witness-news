There has been a concerted push from the IEC and some contesting political parties to get more young people interested in voting, but whether this will yield positive results on 8 May is another story. JOHANNESBURG - Statistics from the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) are a telling picture of the registered eligible voter base for this week's coming elections. Of particular interest, however, are young people under 30. There has been a concerted push from the IEC and some contesting political parties to get more young people interested in voting, but whether this will yield positive results on 8 May is another story. According to IEC stats, over 80% of new voters who registered in March 2018 and January 2019 are between the ages of 16 and 17. The Twitter hashtag #IWantToVoteBut has become an outlet for young voters who are either sure they are not voting or are still undecided to voice the reasons for their reluctance. Most of the reasons range from lack of service delivery, unemployment and other daily lived experiences of young people across the country.
