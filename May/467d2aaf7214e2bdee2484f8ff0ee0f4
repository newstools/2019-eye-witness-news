Gumede is facing a string of corruption charges, including money laundering and racketeering. The Hawks' Hangwani Mulaudzi said that two other municipal officials will also make a brief appearance. "It is the continuation of the case we were busy with two weeks ago, where we arrested nine people. We are adding these three today and I don't think there will be any reason for us to oppose bail. It's about a 2016 R208 million tender, where service providers were given different tenders and they did not service that tender." More to follow.
