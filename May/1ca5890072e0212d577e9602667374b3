MNS Attorneys' Thobani Mnyandu made the submission at the state capture commission of inquiry's public hearings in Parktown on Thursday. JOHANNESBURG – The state capture commission of inquiry has heard how the quoted cost of relocating train manufacturing facilities from Johannesburg to Durban grew from R9 million to more than R600 million. MNS Attorneys' Thobani Mnyandu made the submission at the public hearings in Parktown on Thursday. Mnyandu presented the findings of the investigation into the relocation of train facilities. He said that in 2014, China North Rail submitted a memo to Transnet saying the relocation to Durban would cost about R9 million. But that figure changed 11 months later. "A proposal was submitted by CNR which estimated that the cost to be approximately R100 million for relocation. However, in the same document, chair, it also reflects at the end of it [the report] an estimate for R318 million." A stunned deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo asked whether the board or any of the Transnet officials involved in the negotiations process questioned aspects of the costs. “The costs that were initially meant to be around R9 million could go up to something over R600 million, were you able to see if they were able to raise this issue as explained?” said Zondo. In response Mnyandu said they could see some of the questions that were raised but had no evidence that they were dealt with. WATCH: Transnet OEM deals in spotlight at Zondo Commission
