Cosatu has also questioned the role of deputy ministers in the Cabinet. CAPE TOWN - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said that a Cabinet of between 20 and 25 ministers is what President Cyril Ramaphosa should consider. Cosatu has also questioned the role of deputy ministers in the Cabinet. The union's general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said that Ramaphosa will have to look at people with capacity and competence ahead of the much-anticipated Cabinet announcement. "Our advice we're sending to the president would be to look at people of capacity, competence, people with a clean record. Then he would have to look at the questions of gender, and the youth." Ntshalintshali believes that a mix in Cabinet of young people and those who have performed well in the past will help.
