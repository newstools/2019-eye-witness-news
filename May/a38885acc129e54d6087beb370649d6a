JOHANNESBURG - After holding onto an uncomfortable majority lead since late Friday, the African National Congress (ANC) has managed to retain Gauteng with 50.14%, with 99.7% of the votes counted. The party dipped below the 50% mark during the counting process, prompting talks of a coalition government in the province. The ruling party's lead in Gauteng had been hanging by a thread since vote counting began. After taking a knock on yesterday and going below 50%, opposition parties were pleased that Gauteng could be governed through a coalition government. The ANC's lead dropped again on Saturday morning, but then rose above 50%. But its members said that the province would stay in ANC hands.
