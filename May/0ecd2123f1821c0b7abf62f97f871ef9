JOHANNESBURG – David Makhura has been re-elected as the premier of Gauteng. The African National Congress (ANC) earlier nominated David Makhura for the position but the Democratic Alliance also nominated Solly Msimanga for the same role. Members of the provincial legislature were sworn in on Wednesday morning by Judge Dunstan Mlambo. Before the nominations began, Judge Mlambo said if more than one candidate was nominated, he would suspend proceedings for the members to vote in a secret ballot. The ANC has 37 of the 73 seats in the Gauteng legislature but the DA seemed determined to test the waters. ANC member and outgoing MEC for education Panyaza Lesufi nominated Makhura, who accepted the nomination. The Economic Freedom Fighters requested that party agents be allowed to observe the counting of the ballots and Judge Mlambo allowed it. The elected premier is scheduled to be sworn in later on Wednesday afternoon. MAKHURA’S CABINET Makhura said he would announce his Cabinet by the end of the week. Without being specific, Makhura said the ANC had brought young people into the legislature, and his Cabinet would be made up of younger, more educated people. He said his priorities were jobs and the economy, housing and public transport, with the aim of reaching all residents of the province. Makhura - who won by a slim majority - said he would ensure that the province works well with municipalities governed by other parties such as Johannesburg and Tshwane. “As a premier, I don’t derive joy from blaming men. It’s immature and shows a lack of leadership. I want this province to work and I want to work with every mayor from other parties to make residents of the area happy.”
