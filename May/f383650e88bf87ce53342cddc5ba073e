JOHANNESBURG – African National Congress (ANC) leader Cyril Ramaphosa called on South Africans to vote for the ANC if they want to bring growth and transformation.

Thousands of ANC supporters came out in numbers to hear why the party felt they still need to be trusted by the country. “The future of our country is in your hands. It is in the hands of the people of South Africa,” Ramaphosa said. He called on young people faced with unemployment and want to build a better life that they have today to vote for the ANC. “It is a call for every South Africans to go out in large numbers to vote for a new era of growth … and transformation.” He said this was a moment for SA to choose to return to corruption or hardship or choose a new leap of growth and progress.
