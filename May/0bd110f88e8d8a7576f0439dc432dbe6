"I am extremely disappointed to have my time in Madrid end in this way. Thank you for the support."

Cilic, winner of the US Open five years ago, entered Madrid with a 4-6 record and two clay losses but had started getting his game in gear. The Croatian saved four match points against Martin Klizan in his opening match on Monday and needed three sets to win each of his next two encounters. Djokovic won the Madrid title in 2016 and 2011.
