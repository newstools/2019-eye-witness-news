I am very proud of that! “It’s definitely been a bit of a hard first four races. Naturally, we have a great car, but we don’t always get along. I’m grateful in the race that we managed to settle our differences.” Bottas said: “I lost it there, at the start. The clutch was strange - bite and release, bite and release. I’ve never had that before.”
