JOHANNESBURG - Rural households are increasingly turning to subsistence agriculture and this has led to a decline in food insecurity. Stats South Africa has found that three-quarters of households resort to growing their own food and it's not necessarily for trading purposes. Stats SA said the percentage of households who were vulnerable to hunger reflects the same trend. The General Household Survey found that the percentage of people who experienced hunger decreased from 29,3% in 2002 to 11,3%.
