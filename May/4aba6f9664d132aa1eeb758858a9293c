JOHANNESBURG - South African climber, Saray Khumalo successfully completed her descent from the top of Mount Everest just over two days after climbing the mountain. Khumalo arrived at base camp on Saturday afternoon after making history as she became the first African black woman to summit the iconic mountain. Two of her climbing partners died during the descent which dampened celebrations. Khumalo's friend Erika Gibson said: “They arrived at base camp and that in itself is a comfort because she can get to start to process everything that happened in the last weekend.” KHUMALO TO REST, RECUPERATE ON SUNDAY Khumalo told those close to her that she would be using Sunday to recuperate and process what had happened over the last few days. While Khumalo’s achievement was still being celebrated, the team used their day off to recuperate physically, mentally and emotionally. Khumalo's friend, Erika Gibson said Sunday was a day of resting and would be used to decide the best way to return to lower ground. She said: “At this stage, there is no definite time when she will be returning; there are still a few factors that can influence that. She just wants to rest and be at peace for a while. Today is rest day for them.” She's expected to only return to South Africa in at least a week's time.
