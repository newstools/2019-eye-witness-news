CAPE TOWN - A seasonal farmworker accused of killing a farm owner in Bonnievale is expected back in court next week. Ntabanyane Tlali appeared in the Bonnievale Magistrates Court on Thursday and will remain in police custody. The 19-year-old is alleged to have been one of four men who attacked a couple on their farm on Monday evening. Tool Wessels was killed in the attack, while his wife, Liezel, managed to escape.  However, she was not unharmed. The 55-year-old was tied up, stabbed and tortured with boiling water. Her husband's body was found a few hundred metres from the house. Lobby group AfriForum said the accused was a local seasonal farmworker. Itâ€™s alleged the 19-year-old and three others may have wanted cash. Police have confirmed firearms were taken from a safe. AfriForum said at least 12 attacks on farms were reported in the province since January, including three murders. (Edited by Shimoney Regter)
