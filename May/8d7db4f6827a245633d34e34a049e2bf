By Friday afternoon, the ACM had only received just under 4,000 votes (0.03%), much less than what is required to get one seat in Parliament. JOHANNESBURG - African Content Movement (ACM) President Hlaudi Motsoeneng is adamant that he is a good candidate for the South African presidency, despite his party's poor performance in the elections. Motsoeneng appeared reserved at the Electoral Commission of South Africa's (IEC) results operations centre in Tshwane after initially showing confidence on Thursday morning. By Friday afternoon, the ACM had only received just under 4,000 votes (0.03%), much less than what is required to get a seat in Parliament.

I don't need to be a councillor, I need to be a person taking decisions. "I have huge experience in turning around the lives of people..." #ElectionResults "I know to run South Africa, man" says Hlaudi Motsoeneng. As things stand now, his party has 3,800 votes (0.03%).
