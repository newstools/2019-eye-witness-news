On Saturday, police had to be deployed to the area as tensions boiled over between alleged land grabbers and community members. JOHANNESBURG - Residents in Lenasia South have slammed alleged land invaders in the area, arguing that homelessness does not legitimise occupying vacant property. They said several other community members had been waiting for title deeds for some time now. On Saturday, police had to be deployed to the area as tensions boiled over between alleged land grabbers and community members. The JMPD said they were investigating two incidents of land grabs in Lenasia and Wimbledon, south of Johannesburg on Saturday. The area had been a hotspot for land grabs with Lenasia residents last week threatening to shut down the area in protest against illegal land occupation. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said officers were monitoring the area. “There have been a few reports of illegal land invasions. One in Extension 9 and in Wimbledon and officers have been sent to investigate what is happening,” he said. The Lenasia Civic Association's Joy Govender said: “These people are coming from outside, they are not our community members. They are coming from Zimbabwe, from wherever… what about the people who have been staying in Lenasia South since inception?” Govender said residents would remain resolute in their demands. “Until the land invaders don’t leave, we are not leaving,” she said. TENSIONS MOUNT Tensions continued to mount between Lenasia South residents and land grabbers Residents said homelessness was no excuse for land grabs. Raji Appanna Whoi had been living in the area for more than 50 years said the law needed to prevail. “The land grabbers have been unlawful in their activities… and I don’t think they should be stealing the land like the way that they’re doing.”
