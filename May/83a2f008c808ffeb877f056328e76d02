The red beret leader made the remarks during the party's post-election briefing in Braamfontein. JOHANNESBURG – Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said the party's growth was attributed to a deliberate re-strategising of its deployment teams which strengthened the organisation. The red beret leader made the remarks during the party's post-election briefing in Braamfontein on Thursday. The EFF was the only party to have grown among the top three organisations, securing 10% of the national vote which translated to 19 seats in Parliament. The EFF also showed significant gains in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Malema said the party would stop at nothing to secure the interests of African people. He said: “We reiterate our call for African unity. We continue to advocate for free movement of goods and people in the African continent which is long overdue. We will never retract on this statement even if it threatens our electoral growth.” At the same time, Malema accused the African National Congress (ANC) of securing the province of Gauteng through dodgy dealings. The hotly-contested economic hub had the ANC on tenterhooks, with speculation rife that the region would have to be governed through a coalition agreement. In a last-minute showing, the ANC managed to secure a majority government in the province by bagging just 50.19% of the votes. Malema said this marginal victory had motivated the EFF to work even harder: “The ANC didn’t get 50%. The ANC is going to govern Gauteng through fraud. They’ve not won the elections, but we’re a peace-loving organisation that believes in the will of the people. Let the people decisively remove the ANC.” The Democratic Alliance (DA) remains the official opposition in the province with 27.4% of the vote, while the EFF rounded up the top three with 14.6%.
