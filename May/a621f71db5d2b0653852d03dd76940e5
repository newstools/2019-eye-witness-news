Caster Semenya lost an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport earlier this month over measures imposed by the IAAF that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women. PARIS - South African runner Caster Semenya said on Wednesday she had lodged an appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court to challenge a decision over IAAF rules forcing her to lower her testosterone levels. Semenya, a double Olympic 800m champion, lost an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport earlier this month over measures imposed by the IAAF that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes - or those with "differences of sexual development" (DSD) - to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women.
