CAPE TOWN - An 18-year-old who was caught allegedly masturbating on camera at a gym is expected to appear in court soon. The teenager was arrested on Thursday after he was caught on camera two weeks ago by another gym user at Virgin Active's Stellenbosch outlet. “An 18-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Stellenbosch Magistrate Court after he was arrested for sexual assault yesterday. The suspect will appear on 13 June at the court,” said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana. He was not in police custody and had been served a notice to appear in court. Virgin Active South Africa terminated the 18-year-old's gym membership, banning him for life and reported the matter to Stellenbosch police on 20 May.
