Police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone said: “In Ganyesa, a vehicle belonging to a presiding officer was allegedly set alight; the whole vehicle burnt. And then, in Ikageng, one of the paper boxes was also burnt, but in other areas, it was just service delivery protests.” Officers will be deployed to these areas and other hotspots as voting continue.
