Former President Jacob Zuma joined ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule in Lamontville, Durban, to campaign ahead of the national elections on 8 May. KWAMASHU - Former President Jacob Zuma said on Friday he still doesn’t know what he has done to be labelled as corrupt. Zuma joined African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule in Lamontville, Durban, to campaign ahead of the national elections on 8 May. The two handed over a house to 70-year-old struggle veteran Amos Ndalwane before heading to a door-to-door in KwaMashu. Zuma said those who say he shouldn’t campaign, should first explain what it was he had done wrong. “I can’t tell you what provoked that question. What have I done that’s corrupt? I would listen to them if they were to say this is what Zuma has done, so far, I’ve not heard anyone say this is what Zuma has done.”  ‘DO NOT LISTEN TO THE MEDIA’ Magashule claimed concerns about Zuma campaigning for the ANC were fabricated by the media. The two crisscrossed Durban and concluded the party campaign trail in KwaZulu-Natal ahead of 8 May elections. Magashule’s knives were out for the media on Friday; out of the blue, he told ANC supporters not to listen to what the media was reporting. “The media must quote us live because when we are live, you can’t distort anything.” He was asked to comment on concerns that some in the ANC wre worried that he and Zuma were liabilities for the party. “I don’t think there are people questioning... it’s the media. That’s the agenda and propaganda of the media. We are ANC leadership and we will campaign anywhere in South Africa.” He also blamed the media for making an issue of him calling Zuma president and said all former leaders of the movement are addressed as president as per the culture of the movement.
