The ANC president was speaking at the party's Siyabonga victory celebration at Luthuli House on Sunday. Ramaphosa has made a bold promise to the party's supporters that they will not take them for granted. With the party winning the election with 57%, Ramaphosa said that this was a clear indication that the people’s needs must come first and not the ANC’s internal factional battles. “We’re the ANC that’s humbled, that’s going to serve our people with humility; the ANC that’s going to listen to the people of our country.” Ramaphosa said the party would also embark on a countrywide door-to-door campaign to hear citizens’ concerns. “We have a clear mandate and we can say we’re going to do what our people want us to do.” WATCH: Ramaphosa: 'They wanted Gauteng now they're licking their wounds'  (Edited by Leeto M Khoza)
