For some South Africans it’s a simple request to Ramaphosa be a transparent and honest leader. “This time I don’t think there will be corruption because Cyril Ramaphosa is strict,” a man said. “I pray he doesn’t disappoint us,” another person said. South Africans cheered loudly for former president Thabo Mbeki when he arrived at the stadium, while others used the opportunity to chant “where is Jacob Zuma” who was absent.
