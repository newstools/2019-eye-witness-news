JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he's been working tirelessly over the last few months preparing for next week's elections but is confident he will come out victorious. Ramaphosa spent Thursday morning at the Nedbank offices in Johannesburg, engaging with youth who are part of a programme that employs hundreds of people, giving them an opportunity in corporate business. The president encouraged young people to reach for their dreams despite the challenging circumstances they were born into. As South Africans prepare to vote for a new government on Wednesday, Ramaphosa told the group to never give up, as he has put in all his efforts for this elections. "We are going into an election and I don't know what the outcome is going to be. But you know what? I am going into the elections very confidently, very robustly and with a very positive mind, knowing that I am going to emerge victorious." “Sometimes you’ve got to kiss lots and lots of frogs, you’ve got to keep trying and trying and sometimes failing.” Ramaphosa has told the youth there he initially wasn't able to pursue his dreams because he lived in a home where his mother was a domestic worker and his father a police officer, and there simply weren't any additional funds. Now, several years later and even at the helm of the country, he said he was still pursuing his dreams without fear. Ramaphosa said he had been working tirelessly the past few months preparing for next week's elections. “I’ve been giving this election effort my all for the past few months even having up to eight meetings in a day, the people running my campaign work me to pulp and by the time I go to bed, I’m finished.” The president said he was concerned thousands of young people couldn’t find jobs, despite having tertiary education.
