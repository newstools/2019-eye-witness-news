President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce a greatly reduced team after he is elected as president by the National Assembly next week Wednesday. CAPE TOWN - Following last week's elections, President Cyril Ramaphosa  is now left with the tough task of considering members for his new Cabinet. Ramaphosa is expected to announce a greatly reduced team after he is elected as president by the National Assembly next week Wednesday. In his maiden State of the Nation Address last year, Ramaphosa announced he would reduce the number of his ministers. WATCH: Was Ramaphosa the ANC's saving grace? Ace Magashule explains  It’s being speculated he will cut the size of Cabinet to just 25 portfolios and only some will have a deputy minister. Former President Jacob Zuma’s Cabinet had 35 ministers and was considered one of the biggest in the world, casting a shadow on the United States’ 15 ministers and Kenya’s 18. Ramaphosa assured a party post-election gathering on Sunday he would make the best choices. “I am going to appoint men and women who are capable and have great capabilities.” ANC national executive committee members and previous ministers are now waiting anxiously to see if they will make it back into the executive. Presidency spokesperson Khusela Diko said Ramaphosa had not yet made any final decisions. “I can assure you that the president has not made any decisions relating to Cabinet. We have said that he will take the time to apply his mind.” Ramaphosa’s expected Cabinet cull will save the country hundreds of millions of rands, should he get rid of certain departments. Last year, the Democratic Alliance in Parliament estimated that the 35 ministers and 37 deputy ministers would earn more than half a billion rand over the medium-term three-year period. The ministerial handbook currently recommends that ministers’ and deputy ministers’ private offices be limited to 10 and six staff members respectively. (Edited by Mihlali Ntsabo)
