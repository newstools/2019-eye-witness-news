Three judges of Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) last year denied Van Breda's appeal to overturn his conviction and sentence for the murder of his family. Van Breda then turned to SCA President Mandisa Maya who also dismissed his application on Wednesday. By law applicants are allowed to petition the Judge President of the SCA on a decision taken by the court's judges.
