CAPE TOWN - Civil rights organisation AfriForum encouraged residents living in rural areas to join safety structures following a spate of attacks on farms. According to the group there have been four attacks in Paarl, Stellenbosch and De Doorns this week. Afriforum's Johandré van Zyl said two incidents occurred in Paarl last week. In De Doorns, two residents were wounded during the robbery and in Stellenbosch, a police officer was killed during the robbery while pursuing the suspects. Ipid and the Hawks are also probing the constable's killing.

These are unique farms and require unique strategies.”
